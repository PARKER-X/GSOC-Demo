my sister is a light ass sleeper!!pls!! it is actually driving me insane!!! (Read the whole thing if you can),"So I go to work and school all day and the only time me and my friends can game is between 11pm-3am. Me and my friends talk on discord and react to the game of course but my sister's room is right next to mine and she always gets mad that im loud when shes trying to sleep while im gaming EVEN WHEN I AM NOT EVEN TALKING THAT LOUD!? its SO annoying because me and my friends usually play games that require comms or even horror games. my friends can react and what not but i cant react or make jokes to make the experience more enjoyable due to the fact that im basically whispering into my mic the whole time trying to avoid waking up my sister.
It's just not enjoyable since i can't really talk at my normal voice or react to what's going on in the game which adds to the experience of playing games with my friends. Late night is the only time me and my friends can play and it's just so annoying be this is essentially my only free time to have fun and wind down after a long ass day of working. any tips on suppressing noise of my voice or any ideas??? thank you :)

I know people might call me inconsiderate but the fact i even ask for tips and what not is because IM BEING CONSIDERATE for not wanting to wake my sister up. to add on, SHE EVEN GETS MAD AT ME FOR USING THE BATHROOM LIKE BRUH AM I SUPPOSED TO JUST HOLD MY PEE IN OVERNIGHT OR EVEN WHEN I GET HOME FROM WORK AROUND 11pm LIKE BRUH IM TRYING MY BEST TO BE QUIET BUT I HAVE BRUSH MY FUCKIN TEETH AND CHANGE TO MY SLEEP CLOTHES AND WHAT NOT WHICH REQUIRES A BIT OF NOISE (o!??! it seems like every LITTLE FRICKIN NOISE WAKES HER UP. LIKE ONE TIME I COUGHED A LITTLE AND SHE TEXTS ME ""BE FUCKIN QUIET IM TRYING TO SLEEP"" LIKE DAMN I GUESS I CANT EVEN COUGH TOO?!? it's to the point where im holding in my coughs and pees unless i need to pee or cough so badly then i'll do them. like i said i go to school and work all day. these inconvenient hours is my ONLY free time of the day and the only time me and my friends can even game. i want to have fun and not live a boring, depressing work-filled life. if i could game during the day while she's awake then i would but unfortunately with my busy schedule i cannot do that. like i said i still wanna have my fun and unfortunately my only free time is during the late night hours. i work 5-6 days a week and go to school 4 days a week while working my second job from home 3 days a week and can never have my fun time. playing games with my friends really helps me recover mentally after a long day. I have severe depression and panic disorder so gaming with friends really helps me a lot. This whole ordeal with her getting mad at every little noise even with things i can’t really control (like needing to pee or coughing or getting off work late) is actually driving me insane!!! my mental health is already bad but this adds onto it!! Thank you for those who actually read the whole thing :)",mentalhealth,,SUPPOSED,49.81597780500976,-124.45672246468762
I am in over my head,"Over the past 3 years my (23m) life has been declining rapidly. I've lost it all. Every month I feel like Im dragging my already dead body through glass and salt. 

I get max 4 hours of sleep a day. If I try to get more my body will naturally wake up every 30 minutes without fail, on the dot. But everytime I do wake up it's either from myself screaming or hyperventilating. I don't remember if I had a nightmare. Idk if a brain can even produce nightmares within 30 minutes. 

My living situation isn't the worst. I mean, I don't live in Palestine and i dont get treated like cattle. But for an American my age it's not ideal. I'm practically homeless, without a car. I'm living in an abandoned cabin in the woods. I take care of it, but it's not mine. 

It can't be good for my psyche. If I had to give anyone a deep dive into what my mind feels like, there are multiple conversations going on at all times. They aren't muffled, they talk over eachother but it's as tho I am there for every single one solo style. It's flooding with negativity.

My coworkers call me schizophrenic but I am not diagnosed, nor do I see or hear things. My days consists of 20 hour long panic attacks, sometimes causing me to cry on my floor from the overwhelming depression and guilt. 

I am sober. I used to not be, but I am not. More times than not I get accused of doing meth. Or crack. Or some fucked shit. But I am not. When I did drink, I was a completely different person. Not after the drinks, but my life when I did. I used to be 250 pounds and partied like crazy.

Now I am 120 pounds. I can't eat. If I try i gag and shake and my brain shuts down. I am hungry. I can't eat. I mainly eat uncrustables and drink unsweetened tea. And that's it. I can't handle any more.

I just want to be healthy. I want to gain weight. I want my own home to care for. I miss my ex. I should've married her. I miss my friends. I should've been there for them more.",mentalhealth,,Palestine,31.7621153,-95.6307891
Relationship problems affecting my mental health.,"My ex is with my old friend, and trying to get back with me, after cheating on me 14 times. She was my first relationship, and she really fucked me up. Lasted 10 months, ended two months ago. I'm trying to get serious with a girl named Chloe, who has Terrible mental health but is the best person. I really like her, and we act like were together but she says she doesnt want ""labels."" And then there's a girl named Tenley that I think is actual relationship material, but lives have a province away. Also my friends are trying to get me with some girl named Giovanni and some girl named Emma. What is happening.",mentalhealth,,Giovanni,46.2227946,11.268265
this isn’t needing relationship advice..,"help. it sounds like i need relationship advice but it’s not.. i need help. 

its insane to me how my head works. these things happened at the beginning of everything, LITERALLY 3 DAYS INTO US TALKING. happened back to back in order. ok? ok cool. 

1. ONE COMMENT..
a comment that was said to me as a joke. 
(didn’t know it was a joke at time it was said, i took it personal as f*ck)

2. ONE DM.. 
a dm from a b*tch who was jealous. (proven to me to be wrong in fact)

it is now almost 2 months later. i am 110% not over either of these situations. ill explain why i need to be over them, and why im not. 

the comment: 
i need to be over it because it was made by my brother. we’ve been through almost all the same stuff. yk. that level of trust was there. 
im not over it because i cant get what they said out if my head. i heard it, it was instantly drilled. it was over from that moment. it was only over for me bc we’ve been through identical things.. i was in my head. 

what was the comment? “dont get attached.”

the dm: 
i need to get over the dm. she texted me wild $hit about a man i met ONCE. i had only met him ONE TIME. for me to be acting like this??? come on now. literally blew my fuse on him the second time i met him bc of it, yet he stayed? idk. 
im not over it bc i have trust issues. i don’t trust that things (yk things) didn’t happen. at the same time though, IT. SHOULDN’T. MATTER. i met dude ONCE. 

sorry if this isn’t ok to post. i need advice/help/whatever someone can give at this point. help me overcome it without getting rid of what i want. someone’s gotta understand. ",mentalhealth,,US,39.7837304,-100.445882
I wish I can cut my mom out of my life,"I’m 24f and I’ve been dealing with constant stress, anxiety and depression for the past 3 years, all due to my family. My mom and I have a very toxic relationship where a fight happens and we don’t talk for a little while, then she’ll contact me acting like nothing happened. I understand she is my mother, she gave birth to me, she doesn’t hesitate to remind me that whenever she gets angry about something. 

My mother is a terrible person. I feel awful writing this but I know it’s true. She only cares about money, how other people think of her and materialistic things. I on the other hand have very different values. Especially when it comes to dating, I value a good healthy relationship where I admire someone’s personality and kindness rather than how much wealth they have. My mother doesn’t have one ounce of respect for someone who doesn’t have some sort of wealth. My partner is someone I love deeply, during my darkest days where I was very close to ending my life, he was my hope. I’ve told my mom that multiple times and she doesn’t care. 

She’s constantly comparing my partner to other men, saying my standards are too low, he can’t even afford to take you on daily shopping sprees, pressuring me to move back home, calls me a horrible daughter if I don’t want to hang out with her, the list just goes on. 

My depression, stress and anxiety all come from my mom and how she treats me. I feel miserable and scared whenever she asks me to hang out or when she texts me or calls me. I feel my heart beat so fast due to my anxiety. Cutting family members out of your life isn’t a simple decision but if I’m struggling so much just to go about my day to day life because of how bad my mother treats me, is that enough to tell her I wish to not talk to eachother anymore? Or if there a better way to go about things? Please keep in mind, I’ve talked to her thousands of times about how I feel and she acts like she cares and it’s back to square one the next day..

Is there a USA-equivalent to Andy's Man Club?,"So in the UK, there's an organization called Andy's Man Club where grown men meet on a regular basis (there are a bunch of local chapters).

Country with the best mental health care?,"
Given my naturally curious mind, I recently researched which country has the best mental health care system in the world. Unsurprisingly, Sweden often ranks highly in this regard. Having had personal experiences with Sweden’s mental health services, I can attest that while the system is indeed strong, there is always room for improvement.  

In Sweden, involuntary inpatient care falls under LPT (*Lag om psykiatrisk tvångsvård*), which translates to the ""Law on Psychiatric Compulsory Care."" This represents the highest level of intervention, alongside outpatient treatment options. My own encounters with this system both involuntary inpatient care and outpatient services have given me a nuanced perspective on its strengths and limitations. Despite Sweden’s global reputation for excellence in mental health care, like any system, it is not without its challenges.  

This leads me to wonder: How does mental health care operate in your country or state?Whether it’s involuntary care protocols, outpatient support, or general accessibility, I’d love to hear about your experiences or insights. After all, understanding different systems can help us recognize global progress and identify areas for growth.  

Looking forward to a thoughtful and respectful discussion!

I need help with my mental health,"Posting on here because for the past month or so every single day my mental health seems to be getting really bad, for years I’ve struggled badly with my mental health but this is something different. Been through years of suicidal thoughts/ attempts, the lot. Had alcohol addiction, drug addiction (cannabis) but I have been away from cannabis and not had a drink since last July due to making a mess of everything when I do drink. Now when that happened I got referred to a crisis team. Which is okay for about 2 weeks until they decide you’re fine and patch you. But they did suggest I might have adhd with the way I behave and my life has went for me. But recently my mind just doesn’t seem to stop. I’m not thinking about anything but all I can feel is my head playing what I can imagine a game of pong being like but it’s in my head, goes from side to side and it’s all the time. I cannot focus at all properly on anything because I’m so stressed out and it’s really making me want to give up and do something. Like really do something instead of just an attempt or something that won’t end up killing me. I’m a dad with 2 kids, barely work the now due to less hours so I’m a stay at home dad, my son struggles with autism / adhd and he can’t control
Emotions, tells me he hates me constantly, and I just feel like I’m failing everything. I dunno what to do because mental health services are terrible and don’t do anything, won’t listen and I just don’t know what to do anymore, can anyone please give me some sort of answer because I’m ready to give up.

I [30F] get weirdly sad and depressed when I visit family or places I used to live,"I'm currently visiting my brother, the only person in the family who isn't toxic and is easy to get along with.

Every time I visit family or somewhere that reminds me of all the places I used to live as a child, I get this weird sadness or depression.

I've moved a lot in my life. My parents would move us around every few years. I've had many friends that I've had to say goodbye to. We lived in three different countries with different cultures which I know very well of annd consider myself lucky to have been involved in.

I moved to the Netherlands 8 years ago. I consider the person I was before moving there a completely different one to who I am now. I moved from a toxic environment to a loving one and have become someone I could 't possibly imagine. I'm very proud of myself.

Now, when I visit my family, I start remembering everything I've had to leave, all the people I've abandoned. Old friends I'll never see again. I start mourning everything. It makes things really difficult. I'm scared to face the old me, the depressed me who had no identity and only did what I was told and thought I could never be anything than what my parents have become (nothing I envy, with all due respect). It also leads me to feel like my life in NL is so very fragile, that I could lose everything in an instant and become that old person again.

I just wish I could visit without all this stuff coming up...

I just needed to vent and try to process my emotions as I write. I am going to start EMDR soon and am getting help for my poor little troubled mind.

"My Brother Threatens Suicide When He’s in Trouble, and I Don’t Know How to Help","Hey guys, this is a long one, so thanks for reading.

My brother (16M) and I (17F) have always been close, but over the past few years, he’s been getting into trouble—petty drama, one run in with the law, and being disrespectful at school. My parents have let a lot of his behavior slide, and at this point, it hurts his ego to admit when he’s wrong and he refuses to do so, only making excuses for his behavior.

Honestly, if it weren’t for the threats, I wouldn’t be as worried. He’s not doing anything extreme—just typical teenage boy nonsense. All his friends act the same way. But every time he gets in trouble, he threatens to kill himself—not to my parents, only to me and my sister. His latest was over my parents making him apologize in person to a teacher he disrespected. He texted me saying he will kill himself if he has to apologize. 

I can tell he’s struggling deep down, but I don’t know how much of this is genuine and how much is just him trying to get out of consequences. Either way, it’s exhausting. Our home life can be messy, and I’ve struggled with depression myself. Therapy has helped me a lot, but we live in a rural, conservative town where mental health is really stigmatized. My brother refuses to get help because he thinks therapy is stupid. No matter what I say, he won’t even consider it.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. His selfishness and disrespect are draining, but this constant fear that he might actually follow through on his threats is even worse. I feel like I’ve tried everything to get him to open up, but he just doesn’t care. I don’t know how to help him when he refuses to help himself, and I don’t want to keep carrying this weight alone.

Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks for reading.",mentalhealth,,Trouble,36.0015926,-105.5298903

I’m so grateful, and I just wanted to share this life-changing moment.

Thinking outside of the box,"I'm 51 years old with mental health conditions that put me well past my expiration date. For the most part, listening to that MD at the medical clinic at my university in my early 20's put me in this situation. The SSRIs that were foisted on me either brought out or caused what I'm dealing with now. While I suspect that this was the overall design to ensure that I stay a lifelong customer of pharmaceutical companies and health service providers, this is, of course, speculation. Years of therapy and switching meds have only made the situation worse. I still have responsibilities that I have to tend to. While ketamine injections, EMDR, and other alternative therapies have been kind of effective, it hasn't been enough. Any other suggestions from those who don't prescribe medications by default?",mentalhealth,,MD,47.2879608,28.5670941

"I work on a Mental Health Unit, a patient of mine was sexually assaulted and my bosses are covering it up. Need help","So as the title states I work on a mental health unit in northern Alabama. I’ve been here for almost 6 years but with this organization for close to 10. They’ve done some really horrible things that I’ve witnessed and wanted to come out about but HIPAA and the fear of no one caring stopped me. This past week however, we had a female 30yo admitted to the unit with intense psychosis, she suffered a head trauma after a car accident which resulted in her brain being atrophied. Someone from my work left their post and the woman had s*x with another male patient. We know this because it was all on video as she was in a camera or CVO room. The woman is not in her right mind by any means. In psych we have what’s called orientation levels to determine how well a patient is perceiving reality. There’s 4, person (who you are who others are) place( where your at) time (the year and week and day) and situation (understanding why they are there). This woman does not meet any of these. She is medically unable to make decisions for herself. The male patient was alert and oriented. I thought it was just a horrible thing but then I discovered that they’re withholding that information from her and her family. It’s not in her chart. We’ve been asked not to speak about it. And there have been no follow up investigations, lab work, or even rule changes done in relation to this incident. The part that eats me alive more than anything is the thought of this young girl leaving this place without ever knowing what someone did to her in that state of mind. I’m torn, I want to tell someone like her family as she is still extremely psychotic at the moment, but the information may damage them more than it helps. And not only that I’m not sure how I would even go about doing it. I’ve seen this place do a lot of evil things.

"I lost my ability to cry, and I blame women more than men. Men’s mental health","Recently, my gf has been asking me why I don’t show emotion about difficult situations. I responded with “it’s how I was raised” which blew her mind. This was met with a follow up question about what I meant. I told her a story I am going to share here. 

When I was 4. FOUR. I was riding a mini dirt bike with a neighbor of mine. I toppled over the dirt bike and skinned my leg pretty bad. As 4 year olds do. I started to cry. I was then told by my neighbors dad, “hey bud you’re 4 now. 4 year olds don’t cry. That is for 3 year olds.” I have no hate against my friends dad, I still talk regularly with him and he is amazing. But this is where I can trace my problem back to. 

After I told her this story, my gf responded with “but that doesn’t mean you can’t show emotion.” I laughed at this and asked her “when was the last time you felt an insanely strong emotion, but didn’t cry” this was met with silence as she realized, extremely strong emotion and crying are synonymous, the same, complimentary. She then asked “well what do you do instead of crying, that pain has to go somewhere.” I proceeded to explain that for her, crying is her outlet, but for me distracting myself is the way I get rid of feelings. I told her “eventually I avoid the feelings long enough until they fade away until they aren’t as painful, then and only then, I can address them.” She told me “you know you can come to me with anything right? I will love you no matter what.” I just nodded and said thank you. 

Little does she know the last 5 partners I have been with have said the same thing. Word for word, bar for bar, the same. Yet they “didn’t want to hear a sob story.” And if I actually got to open up about my emotions, they were used as a weapon later on. 

In a later conversation that same night. My partner asked when the last time I cried was. I told her the last time I remembered crying was when my childhood dog died… in fourth grade. I was 10, and I am 20 now. She was appalled by the fact that I don’t remember shedding a tear in a decade and asked “why would you do that to yourself.” I just said “because it’s easier. It’s the world that we live in I just have to accept it.” I didn’t have the heart to tell her that while men may have created this world of emotionless guys, the women of the world are the ones that uphold it.

While men may say “don’t cry” women shame those who do have the courage to cry. Men say “don’t open up, it’s best if it stays inside” and they mean it. They believe it with everything they have. Women on the other hand say “you can trust me, tell me, open up” yet don’t respect the man who does open up as much as they respect the man who doesn’t.

 I realize I’m generalizing but you can’t say “a few bad apples” because I have had 6 mid-long term partners(6+ months) and all 5 of my exes have used my emotions against me. This is too many people for it to be a coincidence. So I am done with this “opening up” because every time I do I get hurt. And every time, it hurts more and more and more.

Teenage mental health,"Hello everyone, i’ll be completely honest I’ve never posted on this app before so forgive me if i’ve broken any guidelines or anything.

I’m a 16 years old guy and i’ve been just feeling generally unwell in my head for the past months i have this constant feeling of not being able to think about my own future and instead i keep having these visions i simply may not be here in a few years time. I have 3 jobs all of which can be pretty stressful and i work quite a lot 

My home life isn’t particularly great my parents are fueled by alcohol and money and over the years have developed less care for me. it’s now at the point where I’m struggling to remember the last time we ever had dinner downstairs or simply the last time we left the house together to go somewhere as a family.

I’ve never really been a very emotional person but over the past few weeks i’ve been making up these crazy scenarios in my head and then i can’t seem to tell whether they are real or not.

I get anxious about the smallest things such as going to the shop at the top of my road or walking into the high-street when schools finished and i know it’s going to be busy.

I have friends but over the years i’ve found myself cutting down the amount to the point where i have quite a small circle. 

This isn’t what i would’ve pictured 2 years back as i was the louder type in school with loads of friends and a very big social life.

What kind of in-person and private help can I get in the UK since my parents do not believe in mental health issues, especially at my age, as they think I have nothing to stress about?",mentalhealth,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525
My friend needs help,My friend is extremely suicidal due to her parents being extremely abusive. She is 16 years old and lives in Texas is there any recourses that I can get her for help.

Feel worthless and as if ive lost my 2nd battle with PTSD and depression,"Typing as a way to try and calibrate my mind. My depression issues are back in full effect and are as bad as they were in 2017 when i attempted to end my life.

Lately, i feel like ive changed. Ive lost my ability to stay composed and calm. I randomly get angry and lash out at my spouse (who does not deserve it). I continue to have night terrors and nightmares that has this evil voice telling me im worthless and must end my life. I try to avoid sleep cause of it.

 I have no friends and the only family i have that talk to me are my parents, who my father subjected me to years of emotional and physical abuse due to alcoholism(which caused and led to a PTSD diagnosis) (age 3-15) and constantly yells at me to tell me im ruining his life by asking to borrow money when i have no money to eat. (I moved out on my own years ago) and my mom who only calls me to talk about how proud she is of my younger brother.


The only good thing that has happened to me this year is us getting a new apartment. That quickly became a nightmare as the above tenant is so loud, it spiraled my depression out of control and causes PTSD attacks.

I feel like the world has closed in on me and im hopeless. I just want my suffering to end. I have no self worth. I hate who i am. I cant afford proper help and the psychiatrist who they did provide to me has used me as a lab rat and keeps giving me different meds, all of which have caused liver issues (medically diagnosed) worse depression and created an agry side of me.

I just wish and pray i will stop suffering. I can hardly afford to eat anymore and cant even afford different meds. Im so scared and feel empty inside. I cant handle another battle like i endured in 2017.

The myth is Canada offers free health care and help but the care you get for free is nothing more than people who wont let you open up and instead push meds on you. I even had a therapist tell me im selfish for ever considering suicide. 

I used to be able to call my Uncle to help me, but he unfortunately passed away in last January. He was the man who acted like a real father to me from day one. No one else cares about me it seems.

This is me venting and also crying out for help. I dont know how much fight is left in me. Im only 32 and feel like my life is over. To finish, i was diagnosed with PTSD, severe anxiety, Severe depression and ADHD.

"I am scheduled for a NPD evaluation, l've never felt so much dread.","20 year old blue collar male here who was previously diagnosed (possibly misdiagnosed) with ASD, depression/anxiety, and ADD.

To put it in simple terms I've had very typical as well a very atypical childhood. Now that I am almost 21 l've understood I generally have never been truly happy ever in my life, other than artificial happiness that I would tell myself to get through the day. I've been in and out of treatment, therapy, and been on a long list of different medications, to no avail. I think about my own death quite often and have since a small boy. My parents are so exhausted of nothing working and coming from a small town in the UP of Michigan they are running out of ideas. My father (John Hopkins grad/Doc) for a long time has suspected me have NPD but after this last evaluation in Dec, it is seaming more of a reality. We had been treating it as ASD as was perceived from last diagnosis, but it has come to be seen after my psychologists opinions on me that it could be much worse that high functioning autism. The other illness they are looking is Bipolar type Il, which between you and me would be so much better than a NPD diagnosis. I always have felt l am a good person but now looking into in it always seems to come back to how others portray me and leads to me obsessing with being the most liked and respected.

The more I learn about NPD, living with it doesn't make the dream of being successful, happy, and finding love feel reachable.

All my life I have wanted to be loved, have group to call my own, have actual friends, and not people who use you for their own personal gain.

 Often been looked down upon by other men in my culture and bullied. 
It's like I can't look at other men in the eyes anymore, all the other men have brow bones and masculine faces. I feel so ashamed of my looks I'm thinking of suicide. I'm isolating a lot. Like my personality has been wrong all this time.
I don't have money for plastic surgery and I'm just lost. Soon finishing my seasonal contract and then I'm between jobs again. I would want to get my face fixed before starting my life over again. I feel so ashamed of my looks and I'm tired of the stares. My personality doesn't match my face anymore as I want to act more masculine.

Wanting to start over,"Mostly need to vent here. I feel like I'm being held back. I lost my mother about a year ago to a rare neurological disease. I witnessed her death, helped with the home hospice care. She sometimes couldn't recognize me, and could be a completely different person - aggressive. I still have some PTSD from it. It hit dad hard. I've never really had a good relationship with my father. Dad yells at me out of the blue but does apologize... sometimes. Mom was the glue. 

My oldest sibling I get along with but does drugs and has high expectations of me, wants me to make a lot of money, or become famous. Her fiance agrees, and brings up ideas on me to do work that could help me achieve more money. Note that the fiance doesn't even work. My other sibling has put themselves in a pretty bad situation and got back with a crappy ex. 

My childhood friend that I hang out with hides behind me a lot when it comes to stressful situations. He talks about politics sometimes, and I don't feel all that comfortable when we talk about it. I'm multi-racial, and he starts parroting these extreme right wing talking points. He has never been like this before - I've known him my entire life. My other childhood friend has turned into a egomaniac trainwreck, and can't hold a job, and bought a house, hoping I'll chip in. My best college friend passed away from brain cancer. 

I'm working a tech company where layoffs have become frequent. I'm taking a class that I have enjoyed and could eventually lead to a job, but it adds more to my plate of things to do. My current boss is kind of ""eh"". I have a new client from HELL. Additionally, my old boss of 5 years pretty much ghosted me after since she approached me about a job at her place. Ouch. 

Then, my dating life. I'm aging (30), and I've honestly only had one person where I felt they genuinely loved me. The dating pool SUCKS in my area. The dates have gone no where, or they live 2 hours away from me. I hope I can experience that feeling again. 

Obviously, me getting a new job and moving to a new place has potential to blow up in my face, but there are things (or people) here that weigh me down. I also despise my apartment living situation. My neighbors are pretty rude. They get loud and I work remotely, and sometimes wake me up, not letting me sleep. The landlord has done nothing, and same thing with the cops. I realize moving could amplify or diffuse this problem. 

Just ""UGGGHH"" lol. I try to treat myself, but life is all too expensive and time is short. My grief comes and goes. I do have good online gaming friends, but I very rarely have time for it. Feels good to write it all out, though. And my neighbors can't hear me whine & moan hah.

I think I recognize the path I must take going forward,"I’ve made several dark posts on Reddit over the past few days. You can see them on my profile if you’re interested lol. But now I recognize what I need to do. 

The path to read The Way of Kings beyond chapter 37. The path to read fantasy I want to experience like The Stormlight Archive, Harry Potter, Camp Half-Blood, The Lord of the Rings, Realm of the Elderlings, Red Rising, Kingkiller, The First Law, The Dresden Files, The Dark Tower, Malazan, Chronicles of the Avatar, A Song of Ice and Fire, The Wheel of Time etc. 

To reread Mistborn. To read Wildbow’s series and whatever other web serials. Webnovels. Smaller scale fantasy. 

Chinese or Greek epics. Whatever else I can think of.

The path to read sci-fi like Animorphs, Foundation, Dune, The Expanse etc. To understand the cosmere’s prophecies. To read therapy and self help books. To read horror, comics, manga. Or watch anime AND cartoons. To understand the HEART and SPIRIT of Islam, and perhaps the HEART and SPIRIT of other religions. 

And to READ and DO everything else I dream of.

I believe I shouldn’t take a path made of one or two choices. I should take a path of many choices. I was too paralyzed between two choices that I never considered a path that stretches a third choice. Or a path that considers MANY choices.

Perhaps I will never see the sure question in my life. But I KNOW the general choice I must take…

Perhaps I stopped at chapter 37 of The Way of Kings because I was so worried about the dark paths Kaladin, Dalinar, Shallan and Jasnah, and perhaps Roshar itself were going through. Or of my own future. And that was a mistake. I just spent the entire day of Eid thinking about everything I could. College, the value of my future accounting degree, the value of a degree in general. The job values obtained by associates, bachelors, and grad school. But… I think Eid is ending with me realizing the value of life is not about money, power, fame, intrigue, or status. 

Life is only as valuable as the PEOPLE we interact with. 

The path forward to reading The Way of Kings and WHATEVER ELSE without focusing on the wrong things. Without breaking my mind. I will try to go out and interact with PEOPLE, instead of being scared of PEOPLE. Perhaps this is the path to reading the rest of the cosmere, reading whatever fantasy and sci-fi my heart desires, understanding the heart of Islam and perhaps other religions. The path of understanding holy texts. The path to read good books. 

There is one and many. There is fate and predestination, but there is ALSO free will and choice. There is honor AND dishonor. Emotion and calm. And perhaps the question of WHAT is TRUE honor and emotion 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

Maybe this is the first step towards not fearing Islam, Prophet Muhammad, or Allah. Towards loving them.

Maybe this is the first step towards truly understanding the Knights Radiant and their oath

i need help.,"(this is pretty long but i am DESPERATE!) hello, i am a 15 year old girl struggling. they say that the first step to recovery is to admit that you need help, but that didnt get me anywhere.

ive realized how narcissistic and egoistical i can be, constantly manipulating and putting others down. 

sometimes when i get very bored, i lead on guys i dont give a single shit about just for fun. i dont know why, but it gives me a sense of satisfaction and i am sorry that i am not sorry at all. i love all the attention until thei start annoying be or they are not entertaining me enough so i switch to somone else.

i even like to refer to them as my ""victims"".

i know you might think im too young to say thing, but i did fall in love once and i was severely depressed and miserable. now i feel mostly numb. before, i used to have that ""fire"" in me. now, that rage only finds me sometimes when somone really pisses me off after ive been holding it all in.

on top of all that, i have an eating disorder. no, i do not wanna get better. i love it, all of it. when people point out my sickly pale skin and how my bones are showing. the random bruising it causes and my shaky hands when i pull yet another clump of hair from my head. the severe anemia that worsened with it and being so weak i cant even walk up a set of stairs.

this is a lot to take in but i just have to say it. i get thoughts about unaliving people. like actually planning a murder and carrying out. and a lot of the times i crave human flesh. it started out as raw flesh cravings, i ate raw chiken once when i was 10. it was so good, but it upset my stomach. i fantasizs about bathing in blood and other stuff like that and the urge to kill is getting stronger by day. i love watching animals turn taxidermy figures and i am fascinated by the killer mind and human body. 

yes, i do have some childhood trauma like my dad not being present and my mom being absent because she was busy with work. i was raised by my grandma until the age of 7 or 8 i think, in a traditional orthodox household. even so, something caused me to grow somewhat wrong from the rest of my family. to develop differently. i feel like a complete stranger and sometimes i have to pinch myself to realize that this is actually true, not just a dream and that this is my actual life. 

i dont know what to do. lately, it feels like my mental health worsened and i dont know how to ask my mom for a therapist. she can be very difficult sometimes and it frustrates me. if you read everything till here, thank you. and i would take anya advice.",mentalhealth,,anya,41.9241495,1.1065082
Will AI make me useless?,"I love drawing and creating things. I want to make a living from it because it’s what I enjoy and what makes me happy. I love practicing and learning new things about art every day. But lately, I’ve been feeling worried about AI. I feel like everything I do is useless and that I’ll never be able to dedicate myself to what makes me happy. Regardless of how good I become at it, I don’t even feel like living when I hear that, in the future, I’ll be replaced by a machine and all my effort will amount to nothing. I don’t know what to do or how to feel about it.

Drawing is the only thing I’m somewhat good at in life and the only thing I feel I could try to build a future with.

"I’ve tried nearly every psychiatric med out there, and none of them work. I honestly don’t think there’s anything left.","I’m 26 and have been struggling for years with severe mental health issues—diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD), chronic anxiety, panic, treatment-resistant depression, anhedonia, and obsessive rumination. My life feels like a constant loop of stress, despair, and emotional pain.

I’ve gone through what feels like the entire psychiatric pharmacy, and nothing has helped me long-term. Most things either made me worse or numbed me out until I was a zombie. The only exception was Rexulti, which gave me one day of relief—a glimpse of motivation, reduced rumination, and a sense of peace I hadn’t felt in years. But after that, it turned into a complete nightmare: severe insomnia, agitation, rage, overstimulation, and emotional volatility. I’ve been taking sedatives like Xanax, Clonidine, and Lunesta, and even they can’t calm me down on Rexulti…

Here’s a rough list of everything I’ve tried:
Antidepressants: SSRIs, SNRIs, Wellbutrin, Trazodone, etc. — either ineffective or made me numb, irritable, more anxious, or even worse physical side effects. 
Antipsychotics: Abilify, Seroquel, Vraylar (initially good, then turned me into a lifeless husk), and Rexulti (see above)
Mood stabilizers: Gabapentin, Doxepin, Topiramate, Lamictal— nothing worked, some caused serious side effects. 
Stimulants: Currently on Adderall XR and IR, helps a little with functioning but doesn’t touch the depression or anhedonia. 
NMDA support: Memantine (currently at 21mg) — subtle benefits but not enough. 
Benzos and sleep meds: also currently on Xanax, Clonidine, Lunesta — they’ve been really helpful helpful but since starting Rexulti they’re now starting to lose effectiveness

I’ve tried therapy. I’ve tried routine. I’ve tried lifestyle changes. I even looked into ketamine, but haven’t been able to access it yet. TMS and VNS are off the table—I’m not interested in those. I’m not even sure I want to try lithium, though it seems like the only “option” left on paper.

At this point, I genuinely feel like there are no more meds left to try. And that’s a terrifying realization. I’m angry. I’m tired. I’m heartbroken. I’m barely hanging on, and I don’t know what else to do.

If anyone has been through this level of medication burnout and found something that actually worked—whether it was a med, off-label treatment, or some unconventional combo—I’m open to hearing it.

Need UK Psychiatrist for Military Exemption Letter (Turkey) - Any Affordable Options?,"Looking for a Psychiatrist for Military Exemption Letter – Need Advice

Hi everyone,

I need urgent help finding a psychiatrist in the UK who can provide a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and a formal letter to support my exemption from military service in Turkey.

The letter needs to confirm:

My ADHD diagnosis and past mental health struggles (including depression, anxiety, ).

My vulnerability due to these conditions, making me unfit for military service.

I've reached out to several organizations, including Psychiatry UK, Clinical Partners, and Mind.org, among others. While these organizations offer services, they primarily focus on talking therapies or connecting individuals with psychologists and therapists. Private psychiatrists, like those I contacted, charge around £1,000 for assessments, which is unaffordable. Furthermore, these assessments tend to be general and don't necessarily address my specific vulnerabilities and needs. My GP is unable to provide the necessary referral letter, and therapy alone isn’t sufficient. I require a comprehensive psychiatric assessment to formally diagnose and understand my condition

The fact that I am gay, which is one of the legal grounds for exemption in Turkey.

I haven’t been to Turkey in seven years due to fears for my safety. Given the political climate and strong homophobia in the Turkish military, I would be at serious risk if forced to serve. My mental health issues, combined with this environment, make me extremely vulnerable.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or know of a psychiatrist in the UK (preferably affordable) who could help? Any advice or recommendations would mean a lot.

Thanks in advance!",mentalhealth,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525

"Trans-led study: UK Survey on Trans people's (age 18+) experiences of eating disorders, eating disorder support, and links with neurodivergence [mod approved]","Hello everyone,

I am leading a research team at Cardiff University who have lived experiences of eating disorders, gender diversity, and/or neurodivergence. We’ve just started recruitment for a new research study exploring the relations between gender diversity, neurodivergence and eating disorders and would really appreciate some help spreading the word to hear from as many people as possible. I have included some more information about the study below as well as the recruitment poster and ways to contact us for further information.

**Who can take part?**

We are inviting people who are:

* trans, gender diverse, and/or non-binary, 
* aged 18+ years,
* fluent in English and based in the UK,
* and have lived experience of an eating disorder (current or historical)\*

 \*Please note, you **do not** need to have received a diagnosis of treatment in order to take part.

**What does the study involve?**

If you choose to take part you will be asked to complete an online survey that should take around 45 minutes. This will include questions about your experience of behaviours and thoughts around eating and your body, as well as questions about your gender identity, mental health, and neurodivergent characteristics. All answers and results from the research will be confidential and the findings will be reported in a research paper that we would be happy to share on completion of the study and publication of the results. For everyone who participates in the study, there is the option to enter a prize draw for a shopping voucher as a thank you for your time and contribution.    

We are aware that our research addresses sensitive topics and have taken steps to minimise the risk of causing distress. In addition to our own lived experiences relevant to this research, we have collaborated with an advisory group of community members with lived experience and professionals in relevant fields, including Beat, in designing this study. This project has undergone review, and has received approval from, the Cardiff University Research Ethics Board \[EC.24.11.12.7066A\].

Partners of Bipolar,"Is there support for spouses of bipolar? I had no understand nor idea bipolar presented like this. When we met I thought ""wow this guy loves and adores me so much, he is so nice and caring!"" Years later I found  that as he was trying to date me he would pick up prostitutes. His stories change all the time, so I never know which version to believe. He is in a manic state most of the time. Blows through money, he cleared all our savings to buy a used car we didn't need. When his business needed a surge of income he convinced  me to take a huge loan in my name-at the same time he brought in secret a business partner - who took everything and split. At 11 pm Husband lets our cat in n himself out. Walked barefoot 12 miles to his mothers. Shocked  I scrambled  to keep a roof over  2 kids and my very pregnant head. Left me in 500k debt ( that his buddy stole) a home going into foreclosure and me in high risk pregnancy. During that episode he also tried to buy a 2 million dollar property while not even having 20 dollars on him.  drinking binges to his buddies who had single women available  - while I was home with a newborn.  he also again disappeared while just going to the store to get cigarettes - didn't show signs of life for weeks. the lies and manipulations are endless. There is no reciprocity, accountability,  responsibility. Recently I found a mini dress, hoop earrings in his underwear drawer and a womens belt. His grand delusions of me having contact with men, work as an excuse - while reality had me ear deep in kids, bills, life zero time left over. He makes sure he throws enough problems at me that I am kept busy. His many online dating sites keep emailing  matches.Last week I found a text from local # on his fake phone number app ""how much to f*ck""  I brought that us in our couples therapy,  but it didn't get addressed, his answer was it was me that has talked to a man 14 years ago on the phone for an hour and a half ! Which the therapist referred to ""excessive ""  Therapy where his delusions are met with support and a valid screenshot of a untasteful proposal is met with ignorance.  The insidious constant behavior is of a 3 year old on a continuous tamper tantrum that describes my husband fairly well. unhappy angry, always  at me or  kids. He refuses help or medication... my idea of sense of a happy family that laughs together has dissolved. humor on my partner has diminished to me hoping he won't be in a fighting mood. The older he got the harder it is   Sometimes he levels off. That's when I breathe.He fuels himself and self medicates with my sons ADHD meds, or prescriptions his father shared with him, a bottle he found prescribed for my kidney infection, Redbulls and other energy drinks... He is always sensitive,  and when truly manic he screams  to me that my voice is annoying and no one is allowed to speak. He had violent episodes he didn't remember and never felt empathetic or sorry for. Had attempts at his own life hospitalized,  I got attacked by his mother and sister who blamed me for it, they don't believe in mental illness.Consequences of his actions always catching up to me cleaning the messes he would leave in his wake. Is there help for exhausted, used up, crumpled up messes like me?",mentalhealth,,Husband,40.0417436,-79.1016949
Burnouts and Mood Swings,"Hi.  I wasn't sure who to reach out to but I just wanted to make a post about how I'm feeling recently. 

  
I read an article recently that there have been an increase of Gen Z (18-28) who have been experiencing burnouts. I've been experiencing quite a lot of it and the ""adults"" (above the age 30) around me have just told me that I'm just overreacting or making excuses. Some of it is understandable, since I've had ""mood swings"" from time to time as a child. But sometimes I would just want to end it all, not do anything or just disappear. 

I've read blogs that say that I should seek support (at my job) but that doesn't really seem the best for my situation since they've told me once before that everyone experiences these things and it's my choice to overcome it or not. Nothing about how or anything but I guess that's what adulting is. 

I was born and raised in Japan, still work and live in Japan so all this mental health stuff is—as you may or may not know—swept under the rug. Which is another reason I haven't even had a diagnosis for ADHD since my parents just tell me I'm making excuses for myself being so incompetent. I feel ashamed to even talk about it with the people living with me. The stress of making a living when everything is so expensive, inflation yada yada, wanting to settle, to marry but being socially awkward, I don't really know how to bond with people. 

I apologize this has gone on and on but I just wanted to ask...From a redditor, to another redditor, are you feeling the same? Burnouts? Mood swings? I'm not really looking for anything inspirational. ",mentalhealth,,Japan,36.5748441,139.2394179

Psychiatrist told me I was “giving up” but couldn’t have been more wrong,"This’s a story from a while back and while I can laugh at it now, it definitely affected me at the time.

I was 15/16 at the time and had an ongoing struggle with suicidal ideation/attempts, self harm and ongoing trauma symptoms that were impacting me deeply. At the time I was diagnosed with C-PTSD and suspected to have autism/ADHD (now diagnosed with both).
I saw two services, one being a private psychologist and the other being CAMHS which is a public mental health service for people under 18 that provides more acute care.

My psychologist was great, she suggested that maybe instead of being thrown on an arrange if SSRIs it may be worth looking at a longer term alternative. She suggested a few ideas, one being an assistance dog/AD (or service dog for Americans). I went home and looked into what an AD could do to help someone in my situation and it seemed promising. Having a dog actively involved in tasking and helping gain independence to take control of my life seemed like a logical approach given how long symptoms persisted.

So after talking about it in depth at our next appointment I took the idea to my psychiatrist at CAMHS. He was so closed off to the idea especially given the fact I was saying that I think medication isn’t helpful and not viable long term. The dude told me that I’d be “giving up” to get an AD and it’s an “easy way out.” Now for anyone who has or knows someone with an AD you know it is a lot of work and it certainly isn’t easy. For him to make this claim was extremely ignorant.

22 years old now and have an AD, he’s a gorgeous 2 year old Labrador who’s still got some training to complete but has made a massive positive impact on my life. I started having multiple inpatient admissions a year ranging from 1-2 weeks but since I’ve had him I’ve had two. He motivates me to wake up, go outside, follow a healthy routine and he gives me a sense of purpose and accomplishment. On some hard days he has easily saved me from myself and I am on far less medication now. Bottomline, he makes me actively try to better my life. It feels good to have proven that asshole doctor wrong and my team now adore my boy and commend us both for how much better my life has become.
This has been so far from giving up, it’s been the push I needed to get up and make my life better. ",mentalhealth,,Labrador,55.0,-69.0
Zero mental health," I don’t know if this matters, but I just needed to put it out there.

I don’t know when it all started. Maybe I was born this way, or maybe life just kept pushing me down until I stopped trying to get back up.

I don’t really know why I’m posting this. Maybe I just want someone to hear me, even if it’s just strangers on the internet. Maybe I just want to know that I’m not the only one who’s felt like this.


I wrote something—a story, I guess—but it’s really just my life disguised as fiction. I put everything I’ve felt into it. The loneliness, the feeling of never being enough, the way people leave like you were never important to them in the first place. If any of that makes sense to you, maybe this will too.

Here’s part of it:


---

I was supposed to be a gift from God. That’s what my name meant—Mathew. A name my parents chose with so much hope, believing I’d grow into something great. But if I was a gift, I must’ve been the kind that no one wanted. The kind that gets pushed to the back of the shelf, forgotten.

I was never the smartest. Never the best-looking. Never the guy people noticed in a room. Just there. A glitch in the system, a face in the crowd, a brown-skinned boy too skinny to be attractive, too awkward to be likable, too dumb to be successful.

But they still expected things from me. My parents, my teachers—hell, even I used to expect things from myself. In India, grades matter more than gold, and I was supposed to bring honor to my family. But no matter how hard I tried, I could never be enough. The numbers on my report card never matched their dreams, and with each passing year, I saw the hope in my parents’ eyes fade.

They never said I was a disappointment. But every time I brought home a bad grade, I saw it in their faces—the silent way my mom sighed, the way my dad would go quiet at the dinner table. And worse than that, I saw the way others judged them. In this country, when a kid fails, it’s never just the kid’s fault. It’s the parents’. The whispers, the pitying looks, the relatives offering “advice” on how to fix me—it was like they were being punished for having a son like me. And I hated that.

And then there was her.

I didn’t want to make this post too long, so I stopped here. But if anyone wants to read the rest, let me know.

I don’t expect anything from this. I just wanted to put it out into the world. If you’ve ever felt like this, just know that you’re not alone. And if you have thoughts, I’d love to hear them.",mentalhealth,,India,22.3511148,78.6677428

Will I be tired for the rest of my life?,"Bullying, dad walking out, emotional abuse from my grandmother, endless issues and problems until the end of high school, mother getting cancer and dying, suicidal ideation, depression, substance dependency, self harm, anxiety, CPTSD and ADHD. All of this before I turned 20 years old. I'm 26 now.

I've been in therapy for 5 years, there's nothing from the past that hasn't been worked through. I have meds that work and keep me stable. I take vitamins and my bloodwork is A+ according to my doctor. But I am. So. Tired. 

I spend majority of my time like I did when I was a teenager skipping school - curled up in a blanket, watching Netflix. I have a few days of productivity here and there when I can do 8h+ of work, cleaning, running errands. All other times I have to FORCE myself to do something. Anything. Even things I really, really end up enjoying. That is if I manage to get myself up. Once I sit down, during any part of the day, the exhaustion hits like a thousand bricks and I can't get up again. My adhd meds can keep me on a task and things are easier to start, my mind feels so much better and positively motivated, but again, my body drags me down. It convinces me I can't do it, that I am too tired. I have no problem bed rotting for days on end, except being emotionally distressed that I'm not doing anything. But getting up feels mentally like physical pressure on my head and all the voices keep fighting in my head ""You can do this"", ""You can't do this you're too tired"". I've had a Monday-Friday 10-18 job, a routine, didn't help. I didn't exist as a person outside of those hours, I crashed the moment I got home. Rest of the time spent recovering so I could start the new week. I'm currently unemployed since February. There are so many things in this life I wish to do, I want do, that I dream about. 

TDLR: Is my nervous system broken from trauma for the rest of my life? Was it just so shot to hell so my physical body can't keep up with me? Or am I just unconsciously still making myself a victim of the past and I'm just too weak-willed? There's people who have gone through so, so much worse, but built themselves up. They pushed through everything to become something better. Why am I not able to do that? What do I need to do to be able to push myself? I want to be better. I want to be the person who could say ""I achieved something that I really wanted"" and ""I got myself up and worked hard for this"".",mentalhealth,,Netflix,40.76376354999999,-73.97430267133896

An Evaluation on Male Suicides,"Suicide among men is a touchy topic for some, but coming to understand it is sometimes good for your well being. Many people I've talked to about this aren't really sure why suicide is prevalent among men, or that it's even prevalent at all. In 2019, males accounted for nearly 80% of the suicide deaths in the U.S., and suicide was the eighth leading cause of death for males, often without a known mental health condition. A study done by the National Library of Medicine revealed that through consulting with the friends and family members of these victims, stress, undiagnosed depression, abuse, and many other factors have been observed before taking their own life. This data had also stated that many of these factors are often downplayed or denied by the victim themselves. According to ""The Gendered Landscape of Suicide: Masculinities, Emotions, and Culture,"" many men commit suicide because they believe that it is a solution to their problems, or that is a method to escape their sorrows. Suicide is a long term solution for short term problems, and may seem as a good method to escape your problems, even though it's not. Many men struggle because they often do not open up to others, and don't talk to anyone. Cultural norms have taught men to silence their emotions, and be strong no matter what, and it's unfortunate. Many men refuse to open up about their emotions because they fear public ridicule. Men should be able to seek out help, and open up about what's wrong without receiving criticism. I do not condone or encourage suicide, I am just simply trying to provide insight on the truth about suicide among men.  ",mentalhealth,,U.S.,39.7837304,-100.445882

How to Handle Toxic Family While Studying?,"Hey guys,

I need some advice for a friend (F23), let’s call her Anna. She’s in a really tough situation at home, and I don’t know what more I can do to help her.

Anna lives with her mom and older sister while pursuing a five-year degree. She had a setback and got dropped for a year, but I’ve seen her working really hard to catch up. The problem is, her family doesn’t see it that way. Instead of supporting her, they constantly compare her to other people, saying things like, “Look at so-and-so, she has a job and makes money while you’re still doing nothing.” They treat her like a failure, even though she’s studying and even working part-time as a gym trainer to support herself (though the pay is very little).

Her mom does tiffin services but mostly relies on Anna’s sister, who is the main breadwinner. And honestly, her sister is the biggest asshole I've ever seen. She constantly insults Anna, calls her a waste of money, brings up finances to shame her and even verbally abuses her whenever she’s in a bad mood. No matter what Anna does, it’s never enough. She’s super careful with money, doesn’t spend unnecessarily, and is trying her best, but the negativity at home makes everything harder.

She dreams of leaving, but she loves her mom and can’t afford to live on her own right now. She knows she has to stay for at least two more years until she finishes her degree. It’s heartbreaking because she’s already struggling with studies, and this toxic environment makes it even worse. I try my best to keep her spirits up, take her mind off things, and be there for her, but I can tell it’s really wearing her down.

The worst part? I have a feeling that once Anna starts making money, her sister will suddenly start treating her nicely. But right now, she’s stuck in this cycle of being belittled every single day.

So, what would you do if you were in Anna’s situation? How do you deal with toxic family members when you have no way out just yet?",mentalhealth,,Anna,39.0204311,-0.6461361
[vent/traumadump] Afraid won’t be well enough to go ball to college for the Fall semester in August (cont. in comments),"I (21m) have been at my college for 4 semesters now. The first 3 were really hard as I dealt with the transition from an adolescence that was really sheltered and atypical and during which I transitioned off from multiple simultaneous medications on which I’d been for years that had been hurting, not helping me, which I wasn’t able to fully quit until my 3rd semester. I was suffering so much there were multiple cold turkey attempts in my earlier semesters about which my family would always find out, which I think just scrambled my brain even more but I was so desperate to not feel the way they made me feel, although they finally accepted me not being on them. 

In the 4th semester everything seemed to be turning around, I finally made this one friend (who’s really cool) and I also began talking to this girl who while ostensibly another friend I actually had mad feelings for. What’s important is that because of my sheltered, overmedicated experience growing up, this was my first real crush/object of my romantic feelings with which I was interacting, despite me being in college. However it wasn’t ok for me keep interacting with her and presenting myself as a friend because she had a partner, granted I didn’t find out about him until 3 months of talking to her, however I could have just made an effort to find out by looking at her Instagram or something and I didn’t cause she was so cool (doing like fashion and photo shoots and stuff) it was too overwhelming because it made me feel so small. 

But the combination of the happy feelings from my new friendship and getting the attention of the girl I shouldn’t have been talking to basically gave me so much hope for the first time, I got into shape and lost a massive amount of weight which was super validating and felt really good (may have gone well into ED territory sadly, going from a BMI of around 29 to 20 in 4 months), got into running which has become a huge passion for me, actually consumed media sometimes (oftentimes I won’t like watch movies, tv, play games etc. cause I had this half-conscious feeling like it was meant for “normal humans”, not me, and that I was doing something “wrong” by engaging with it, I still get a very similar feeling with social media like Insta, Snapchat, TikTok, even YouTube which makes them super stressful and overwhelming to use thus putting me at odds with many members of my generation who love to waste time on that kind of stuff, I honestly wish I could without that shameful feeling). And more then anything all of these just made me feel for the first time like I COULD catch up with all these cool college students around me developmentally, even in spite of my past of being super emotionally volatile (before my meds just made me numb for years, and also having so much anxiety, depression, asd1.

"Vent: Nobody really cares, do they?","Didn’t see a flair for self harm, but its mentioned.
Also sorry if my spelling is bad or it looks like I’ve had a stroke writing.

Now I might seem like the typical edgy teenager with the “ugh! Nobody understand me…”. But genuliley, even if I know people care, I feel so awfully alone.

Recently, I’ve been trying to support my friends, like I usually do, I can’t say I’m amazing at it, but my friends tell me they apriaciate it.
I’m unsure if I’ve said something wrong or done anything, but latley even though I’ve asked my friends to hang out, they tell me they’re ro exausted or don’t reply, then end up hanging together instead. 
They’re not really hiding it, so I don’t think its intentioal. But it kinda hurts.

Also recently, my father found out for the second time that I self harm, he noticed the cuts when I got to confident my shirt wouldnt expose them. He just told me it wasnt good and asked me why, then now for the past days never brought it up again. Last time he found out, he just sent me a link on how to cope in other ways, then never spoke of it again. My mother hasnt done anything either, it’s like they don’t care.
If they care, they don’t show it. I’ve shown signs of mental illness for too long now, even opening up about suecidal thoughts at 11 (I just got yelled at). I tried going to a counsler but he just told my parents everything and they got mad for causing drama I guess. 
Anyways, latley my health has been going up and down, I have friends and a better school, but I’m still pretty depressed. Also my I think I have mind fog which I’ve had for allmost a year now if so. 
I’m tired, find myseld struggling to put things into words, take care of myself, clean my room, do stuff. 

I know people care, but it doesnt feel like it sometimes. I know it might just all be in my head, but I just can’t help when I just randomly feel like I get hit with sudden feelings of sadness or emptyness, its odd, I don’t like it. 
I feel alone.

Chronic pain and mental health in India! Feeling stuck,"For 5 years, I’ve had debilitating lower back/tailbone pain (MRI shows mild disc bulge, but doctors dismiss it) which i think can be psychomatic. I can’t sit >20 mins, walk >1 hour, or focus without exhaustion.  

The worst part? My family’s ""solutions"":  
Just run!
Tie a belt around your waist!
Don't think about the pain (they took psychosomatic pain as if it's my fault and I am in full control and end it anytime I want)!
Anxiety is for losers!

All this makes me dismiss my suffering and stay in denial and belive that I can just go harder and escape this! Which obviously didn't worked in last 4 years and it's my fault that I didn't did enough🙂

I’m sick of being told I’m ""neglecting"" my health when I’m fighting just to function. Pain + brain fog + stigma = isolation.  

Anyone else in India dealing with this? How should I cope in this situation?

I spoke up about suicidal thoughts and nothing happened,"I 27M have been going through a difficult period in work for years. The last 9 months have been absolute hell for my mental health, to the point where the stress and burnout has turned into crippling anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I don't want to go into too much details about the history of it, the only thing worth noting is I have always struggled with anxiety. 

My family has always known about my anxiety and despite not being able to offer any actual support, they have always been respectful and acknowledged it. My work only started to find out when the requests they were asking were causing me significant distress, so I got referred to occupational health which fully detailed my condition, challenges and what support I need. This was 14 months ago, and believe it or not, my workload actually increased after this despite me asking for support. This caused a crash about 9 months ago, a serious crash. My mental health became debilitating, and I felt trapped. I put all my efforts into looking at alternative roles within the company which better support this. 

Fast forward 8 months, 9 interviews later, and I've had no success. I raised a grievance too, which was dealt with unfairly so I withdrew it. I asked for support because I needed it, nothing was done. 

Two and a half weeks ago, I handed a sick note in for 2 weeks and came clean to my boss about the full picture and detailed it in an email. I said I was struggling with bad suicidal thoughts, my wife is worried sick, and I feel utterly trapped. He was kind, compassionate, and supportive. He phoned me the next day with what I thought sounded like good news, he said he has spoken to his manager and they want to redeploy me, and help me out. 

Fast forward another week, someone even more senior denied this request. I am going back on Monday, nothing has changed, and someone senior in my company clearly has a succession plan where I remain exactly where I am and anywhere else I am no use. 

Now before anyone points out that companies are only required to make adjustments that are ""reasonable"", I know this. This company is in the UK, employs more than 40k employees, and moves lots of people about all the time for far less severe circumstances. Just recently, they have advertised 2 positions with the exact same job title as mine but in a much better team externally. I actually said to my employer these would help me, as it's a more relaxed work pace, and the requests are not as unreasonable and it would allow me to heal. Additionally, I am fully competent and able to mentor. They done nothing. 

It seems as though my role, which before I came had people leaving almost immediately, is hard to fill, and they are therefore trapping me in the role. I appreciate I could apply external, but that has its own challenges.i also can't just quit and take some time off because I have a mortgage etc. 

Why even bother speaking up about mental health if no one who can help will help? I feel stupid for telling my work I had suicidal thoughts. I feel cheated about all these seminars etc about mental health where it says to speak up. I feel like it's all a lie. What can anyone do to actually help me if it's work related and the work won't help?",mentalhealth,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525
"All I am seeing is hate, and it's affecting my mental health","I have noticed that I have become more and more distant as the world lashes out at people ( U.S. citizens ) from name calling all the way the threatening. 

I saw four people arguing recently ( I was spectating a conversation ) on my old reddit account that I am trying to distance myself from due to the fact that I had someone physically threaten me, my liberty, and my rights. 

I had to get the police involved because it got so out of control. Some people think it's funny to name call and threaten, but it's not at all. Even when the world says it's okay, it's actually not okay at all. All of this has been making me depression and anxiety act up, not to mention my PTSD. 

Some people from different countries that have begun to defend others have gotten the same ridicule or worse and it's sad. I was talking to someone yesterday, and it ended up with me getting a lot of things off of my chest. 

Right now, I'm fighting back tears..... My anxiety is telling my everything is going to end and there is nothing I can do about it. It's more or less screaming it at this point and I can't take it anymore. 

I'm trying to stay away from weed and other substances like that due to a bad episode that made me hallucinate and go numb, and that is an uphill right now as it's been only three weeks.

I do not expect anyone to talk to me, but it would be nice.

What does it feel like it takes forever to get help with mental health,"Right now I am in the process of trying to get a diagnosis of what’s wrong with me and it’s going to take months talking to different counselors, different therapist, different psychotherapist
Why is it that some people can get diagnosed and get the help they need in a few weeks and some people just get ignored and push the side like they’re worthless trash 

Because I know somebody who has gotten a schizophrenic diagnosis within a week of having issues and seeing his first doctors to talk about that issue and seeing a psychotherapist within like two weeks

I’m going to need to spend months talking to a counsellor and months talking to a psychotherapist and I only have eight sessions so I have to be cured and eight sessions or I’m worthless

I can’t afford ongoing therapy, and the only therapy that’s offered to me is only eight sessions 

I’ve had people tell me that I might have BPD and autism and a whole bunch of other issues and I brought it up to my doctor and he agrees that it might be a possibility but we need counselling doctors and talk about that it’s gonna take months, maybe years to get a diagnosis 

Like I’m being forgotten, ignored and left behind because nobody cares about my problems, because  I’m not worth caring about

Because I’m not mentally ill in the right way 
I’m not schizophrenic to the point where I’m smashing TVs or destroying my belongings 
I’m not threatening others no one fears for their life around me, but I do have issues that are preventing me from being productive member of society and possibly a danger to society. It’s not fixed soon, but no one cares. Do I seriously have to be a danger to society for everyone to actually listen to me. 

I feel ignored every time I express my issues and my problems my feelings, like no one cares enough to help me 
It’s going to take me months to get any kind of progress through counselling
And then it’s gonna take me months of psychotherapy to even get an understanding of a diagnosis and then only then when I’ve gotten a diagnosis they can start treating me they can give me medication they can figure out what’s wrong with me,


What is taking so long mental health services was quicker during the pandemic. I need somebody got a schizophrenic diagnosis. Quickly during the pandemic and he was on pills within a few months. 
And all he did was say that voices were coming from the TV that’s why he smashed it 

I throw out my belongings when I get stressed out and overwhelmed 
I say things, I don’t mean, I believe in delusional beliefs, but I keep them to myself. Do I seriously have to be the end is near guy to be taken seriously 
I seriously have to smash my belongings for people actually give a fuck about my life

I think my brain is permanently wired to be pessimistic and it’s affecting my mental health,"Hi there! To keep it short I’m a very anxious individual my thoughts never stops wether they be good or bad, I go through phases where I feel like there’s no point in being alive. We are put on this earth against our will, then we are forced to work to survive and all we get out of it is a 2 week unpaid vacation. At the end of our working lives we are left to retire for a few years with a shitty pension until a disease kills us because there is cancer in everything we eat. In the process, the rich get richer while 95% of the population is stuck in this “work to survive” cycle, with everything going on in politics right now it’s brought some things into perspective. And systems that are out in place to benefit us in governments ex: healthcare, education, food system governance, are put in place to make the rich richer.

I realize this is an extreme way of thinking but at the end of the day it isn’t wrong. My parents immigrated to Canada from Brazil 25 years ago, my mom is 57 and my dad is 60. They are not retired. They came to this country with nothing and worked their butts off. Why shouldn’t everybody work their butts off? I’m tired of tone deaf politicians not serving their people. They are PUBLIC SERVANTS if we one day stop paying taxes it’s over. But that’s not the attitude that Canadians have. Anyways can someone talk me off this ledge because I’m a very critical thinker and I’m too good at critical thinking lol. What are some things I can do to re-wire my brain?

"18M, can someone relate or help tell me what is going on?","These past couple months, I’ve felt a lot different than I used to before November. Not in any good way at all; well kinda.

I consistently imagine that my ex best friends, ex’s, or really anyone in general are obsessed with me, and I day dream about it a lot. This started around last summer. It’s to the point where, I believe it, but I question it because I wasn’t like this before. In fact, I used to be quite insecure and I lacked a lot of confidence. I still do, but I just have this superiority to others that I can’t let go of. Like, I know I’m better than the people around me, even though I flaws. I just know I’m better than them.

More recently, I’ve become a lot more aggressive lately. My boyfriend hangs out with one of my ex best friends from time to time, because they are somewhat close. And every time they hangout, I tend to leave and go home so I don’t have to be around them. But every time I do, I get so worked up that this friend is gonna try and kiss or do something with my boyfriend, and I can’t help but want to beat the shit out of— no, not the friend, but my boyfriend. I don’t know why. I just want to see his face all battered up to make him understand how I feel when he hangs out with people I don’t like. Overall, I just get agitated really fast, and the first things that come to mind are beating the shit out of them, or harming them in some way, no matter who it is. Again, this is not something I eve ever thought of or even done before while back.

Also, more recently, as in the past few weeks, I can’t stop thinking about space and the meaning of life. I’m stuck in believing that no one around me is actually real, or conscious, and I’m the only real alive thing in the universe, or, that if everyone around me is real, then I mean absolutely nothing to the other of billions of people in this world, and I need to die. I need to die if I am not known, or popular, or liked.

I have a family history with mental health, and I already have other diagnoses(OCD, depression, anxiety). Because of my age, I’m not diagnosed with bi-polar, but because of my symptoms and family history I’m currently taking a mood stabilizer, lamotrigine 100mg. I also have a history of self harm, but I’ve been clean for around half. A year now. But, I have had a lot of urges to in the past few months. Another thing that might be important is that I’ve grown up in a really rough/chaotic home; I’m a military brat and I’ve moved back to back since I was a kid, until I was about 9 when my dad got medically retired. He is an ex-addict(crack), current alcoholic, and also has a lot of mental health issues. He is and has been abusive, not necessarily physically, but 100% emotionally/verbally. He is also extremely narcissistic. Nothing big/traumatic has happened recently, besides by dad coming home wasted and aggressive, per usual.

That’s all I have; can someone help me figure what might be going on? I want to understand, because I don’t. Everything has been so sudden, and everything just doesn’t feel real anymore.",mentalhealth,,kinda,57.9946553,15.8926885

Just venting/looking for advice,"I (m/31) have been struggling with thoughts about self harm. Have not done any of it but the thought of doing something to myself have been increasing over the past half year or so. I know that doing something like this is not the solution to anything, but I currently cannot focus on my studies because of it. I currently study English, German and History in order to become a teacher in Germany and am close to finishing my master’s degree. I can’t really think of a time where I was not critiqued in any way by my family. Especially from the husband of my sister. He’s a teacher and even though he is middle school teacher thinks that he is the smartest person in the world and knows everything. He even refuses to accept that he is incorrect, even if the evidence points toward him being incorrect (he refused to accept that the leds from the switch controller display p1, p2 etc, and not the battery charge). Idk if I am overreacting or if I should just push through the last few exams and be done with my degree. I have postponed the final oral exam because I can’t concentrate on the material and don’t want to think about what happens if I fail. Also, if I fail, I would just be a lost cause because I would be 33 without any work experience or apprenticeship.  Nevertheless, I will start a 4-week program at a psych ward to work on my mental heath and my depressive thoughts.

I don’t feel good, i don’t feel excited, i don’t see a purpose in celebrating my birthday, what’s the point of celebrating my birthday? I have been feeling really down in the dumps about turning into this age because i am still in the same spot as i was in high school, i don’t see any progression in my life as to where i should definitely celebrate my birthday. I still live at home with my parents, i don’t have a bachelors degree YET, i make $13 an hour at my job, still don’t have enough money, i just wish I had a jumpstart in life in my early 20’s like a career, an apartment or house, a degree. I don’t see the purpose in celebrating my birthday. I also have been feeling a mixture of sadness and emotional numbness. My body cannot produce tears and I cannot even cry, it’s like my body doesn’t let me. I have been feeling nonchalant and apathetic lately towards everything in life. Like my relationship with my GF (i want us to break up), my relationship with the gym (i have been going on and off, i just give up trying to better my body), like i don’t feel anger, or joy. But sadness and numbness. I have yet to speak to my therapist about this, but I want to get this out of my chest. Could this be depression?",mentalhealth,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
"I feel overwhelmed, devastated and indecisive. Lost my will completely to move forward.","I don't know if this post aligns with the purpose of this group but as I have been facing immense mental pressure and sinking into depression with each passing day, I am just gonna vent anyway. I am an international student currently in UK to pursue my postgrad. As I am from one of the third world countries in asia, It has been my lifelong dream to move to some developed country for a better future for myself. Although my major is immensely math heavy and I had very little exposure to math in my undergard, yet I opted for it as it's one of the most demanding subjects right now. I overestimated my capabilities and decided to do it anyway. Now 2-3 months have passed since I started this degree, I am in the worst mental state in my life so far. Everyday I attend classes and don't understand anything what the teacher and peers discuss about. I am lagging behind in the most basic concepts and failing to apply anything in advanced stages. It doesn't align with whatever I have thought it to be. I made the mistake of not going through the structures thoroughly and now I feel like a failure waking up everyday not knowing where my life's moving towards. I tried to switch  degrees but don't have that option anymore and I don't know what I am gonna switch to either. I am on a student visa and if I walk away from this, this is gonna be invalid soon. I just feel so bad for my father as he invested a big chunk of his hard earned money on this. I just can't go back to my country and face my family like a failure. I am trying to build courage but it's not enough to get through this. To complete the whole thing is well beyond my capabilities right now. No matter how hard I try, I can't get a hold of this. The workload is so much for me at this point that I had to let go my part time for this. Now I am just taking money for my family everyday for everything yet it all going in vain. For the last week it's just me sitting in my dark room and contemplating what could have been and going through panic attacks randomly. I don't wanna live on like this, I don't wanna be a disappoint to my family. I fear if I go back, it's just gonna be so many taunts from people, all those pitiful words to my failure and I forcing my family to go through this embarrassment for no reason. What to do now? I am hoping for the kind words of people who have gone through the same phase in their lives, your experience on how to get through this. I thought I had everything figured out and now I am just stuck here with no one by side, with no option to move on and suffocating under a big pile of dreams. I don't know how to get out of this.",mentalhealth,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525
How long did it take for you to accept that panic attacks were just that 'panic attacks',"As the title says. How long and what did it take for you to accept there wasn't anything physically wrong with you.

My story in short:

I had my panic attacks emerge with a major panic attack 1,5 years ago and had them ever since. Only now I am starting to accept that it is nothing physically wrong with me.


So obviously I thought I was dying and got tested:
Holter, ecg, Heart echo, Stress test, abdominal echo, colonoscopy, Brain mri, asthma tests. Multiple visits to ER. All that was found was that I have mild fatty liver.

What made it worse for me was hearing about those odd cases where people were diagnosed with 'panic' and had something bigger going on. Of course I thought I was one of those because the symptoms were horrible.

So yeah starting to finally accept that yes the mind can trigger some big physical events.

Yeah and i'm all in on health anxiety thats causing my issues.",mentalhealth,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
Mental health resources for an unemployed family member,"Hoping to pick brains here and get advice on if there are any resources for getting an adult sister, who seems to have become stagnant in life, help. My sister (46F) has been out of work for over 4 years (laid off from a her first job/only job she had for 16 years). Currently she is not working (has not even applied to one job since getting laid off) does not attend social activities, lives with family member who pays the bills. She seems to have no motivation to move forward and I cant tell if maybe it’s fueled by depression, anxiety, or a combo, or something all together different. I feel she probably has a lot weighing her down that she has not worked through and my main goal is to get help for her. I cannot financially take it on. Our parents wont either. Does anyone have any advice in terms of resources that I could potentially lead her to (we’re in California if it makes a difference)?",mentalhealth,,California,36.7014631,-118.755997

"Withdrawing from all my courses and losing $25,000","Kind of a vent but I’m a straight A student enrolled in 5 university courses. I have one month until finals are over. I have a long history of psychiatric hospitalizations and I think I might wind up killing myself if I don’t withdraw. I have MDD, PTSD, GAD, ADHD, Bipolar and am transsexual. If I withdrew, there’s probably about a 50% chance I get refunded. This term is $25000. I have been working since I was 13 and my tuition is about half self-funded.

Have I failed at life?,"Hi so il introduce myself. I'm a 28 year old male living in a remote area of UK, I'm currently single (after finding out the last girl I was seeing was sleeping with someone else) I have basically no qualifications, but have experience in doing mechanical work on cars. I still live with my parents and have no job currently after getting fired from the last 2 due to my friend I was working with. When I was younger I got into a lot of trouble but luckily avoided prison. I've had depression for as long as I remember but tried to mask this with drugs (most things apart from crack/heroin). I quit smoking actual weed at the end of last year due to it making me paranoid/lazy and replaced it with CBD. I dont do any other drugs now either and haven't for a couple of years. I feel like I've wasted so much of my life and that now I'm in a position I can't get out of. Basically dug my own grave. So what I want to ask is, is there any point in me still existing? Or should I just do the world a favor and get rid of myself?",mentalhealth,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525
I am in over my head,"Over the past 3 years my (23m) life has been declining rapidly. I've lost it all. Every month I feel like Im dragging my already dead body through glass and salt. 

I get max 4 hours of sleep a day. If I try to get more my body will naturally wake up every 30 minutes without fail, on the dot. But everytime I do wake up it's either from myself screaming or hyperventilating. I don't remember if I had a nightmare. Idk if a brain can even produce nightmares within 30 minutes. 

My living situation isn't the worst. I mean, I don't live in Palestine and i dont get treated like cattle. But for an American my age it's not ideal. I'm practically homeless, without a car. I'm living in an abandoned cabin in the woods. I take care of it, but it's not mine. 

It can't be good for my psyche. If I had to give anyone a deep dive into what my mind feels like, there are multiple conversations going on at all times. They aren't muffled, they talk over eachother but it's as tho I am there for every single one solo style. It's flooding with negativity.

My coworkers call me schizophrenic but I am not diagnosed, nor do I see or hear things. My days consists of 20 hour long panic attacks, sometimes causing me to cry on my floor from the overwhelming depression and guilt. 

I am sober. I used to not be, but I am not. More times than not I get accused of doing meth. Or crack. Or some fucked shit. But I am not. When I did drink, I was a completely different person. Not after the drinks, but my life when I did. I used to be 250 pounds and partied like crazy.

Now I am 120 pounds. I can't eat. If I try i gag and shake and my brain shuts down. I am hungry. I can't eat. I mainly eat uncrustables and drink unsweetened tea. And that's it. I can't handle any more.

I just want to be healthy. I want to gain weight. I want my own home to care for. I miss my ex. I should've married her. I miss my friends. I should've been there for them more.",mentalhealth,,Palestine,31.7621153,-95.6307891
my sister is a light ass sleeper!!pls!! it is actually driving me insane!!! (Read the whole thing if you can),"So I go to work and school all day and the only time me and my friends can game is between 11pm-3am. Me and my friends talk on discord and react to the game of course but my sister's room is right next to mine and she always gets mad that im loud when shes trying to sleep while im gaming EVEN WHEN I AM NOT EVEN TALKING THAT LOUD!? its SO annoying because me and my friends usually play games that require comms or even horror games. my friends can react and what not but i cant react or make jokes to make the experience more enjoyable due to the fact that im basically whispering into my mic the whole time trying to avoid waking up my sister.
It's just not enjoyable since i can't really talk at my normal voice or react to what's going on in the game which adds to the experience of playing games with my friends. Late night is the only time me and my friends can play and it's just so annoying be this is essentially my only free time to have fun and wind down after a long ass day of working. any tips on suppressing noise of my voice or any ideas??? thank you :)

I know people might call me inconsiderate but the fact i even ask for tips and what not is because IM BEING CONSIDERATE for not wanting to wake my sister up. to add on, SHE EVEN GETS MAD AT ME FOR USING THE BATHROOM LIKE BRUH AM I SUPPOSED TO JUST HOLD MY PEE IN OVERNIGHT OR EVEN WHEN I GET HOME FROM WORK AROUND 11pm LIKE BRUH IM TRYING MY BEST TO BE QUIET BUT I HAVE BRUSH MY FUCKIN TEETH AND CHANGE TO MY SLEEP CLOTHES AND WHAT NOT WHICH REQUIRES A BIT OF NOISE (o!??! it seems like every LITTLE FRICKIN NOISE WAKES HER UP. LIKE ONE TIME I COUGHED A LITTLE AND SHE TEXTS ME ""BE FUCKIN QUIET IM TRYING TO SLEEP"" LIKE DAMN I GUESS I CANT EVEN COUGH TOO?!? it's to the point where im holding in my coughs and pees unless i need to pee or cough so badly then i'll do them. like i said i go to school and work all day. these inconvenient hours is my ONLY free time of the day and the only time me and my friends can even game. i want to have fun and not live a boring, depressing work-filled life. if i could game during the day while she's awake then i would but unfortunately with my busy schedule i cannot do that. like i said i still wanna have my fun and unfortunately my only free time is during the late night hours. i work 5-6 days a week and go to school 4 days a week while working my second job from home 3 days a week and can never have my fun time. playing games with my friends really helps me recover mentally after a long day. I have severe depression and panic disorder so gaming with friends really helps me a lot. This whole ordeal with her getting mad at every little noise even with things i can’t really control (like needing to pee or coughing or getting off work late) is actually driving me insane!!! my mental health is already bad but this adds onto it!!

this isn’t needing relationship advice..,"help. it sounds like i need relationship advice but it’s not.. i need help. 

its insane to me how my head works. these things happened at the beginning of everything, LITERALLY 3 DAYS INTO US TALKING. happened back to back in order. ok? ok cool. 

1. ONE COMMENT..
a comment that was said to me as a joke. 
(didn’t know it was a joke at time it was said, i took it personal as f*ck)

2. ONE DM.. 
a dm from a b*tch who was jealous. (proven to me to be wrong in fact)

it is now almost 2 months later. i am 110% not over either of these situations. ill explain why i need to be over them, and why im not. 

the comment: 
i need to be over it because it was made by my brother. we’ve been through almost all the same stuff. yk. that level of trust was there. 
im not over it because i cant get what they said out if my head. i heard it, it was instantly drilled. it was over from that moment. it was only over for me bc we’ve been through identical things.. i was in my head. 

what was the comment? “dont get attached.”

the dm: 
i need to get over the dm. she texted me wild $hit about a man i met ONCE. i had only met him ONE TIME. for me to be acting like this??? come on now. literally blew my fuse on him the second time i met him bc of it, yet he stayed? idk. 
im not over it bc i have trust issues. i don’t trust that things (yk things) didn’t happen. at the same time though, IT. SHOULDN’T. MATTER. i met dude ONCE.

I wish I can cut my mom out of my life,"I’m 24f and I’ve been dealing with constant stress, anxiety and depression for the past 3 years, all due to my family. My mom and I have a very toxic relationship where a fight happens and we don’t talk for a little while, then she’ll contact me acting like nothing happened. I understand she is my mother, she gave birth to me, she doesn’t hesitate to remind me that whenever she gets angry about something. 

My mother is a terrible person. I feel awful writing this but I know it’s true. She only cares about money, how other people think of her and materialistic things. I on the other hand have very different values. Especially when it comes to dating, I value a good healthy relationship where I admire someone’s personality and kindness rather than how much wealth they have. My mother doesn’t have one ounce of respect for someone who doesn’t have some sort of wealth. My partner is someone I love deeply, during my darkest days where I was very close to ending my life, he was my hope. I’ve told my mom that multiple times and she doesn’t care. 

She’s constantly comparing my partner to other men, saying my standards are too low, he can’t even afford to take you on daily shopping sprees, pressuring me to move back home, calls me a horrible daughter if I don’t want to hang out with her, the list just goes on. 

My depression, stress and anxiety all come from my mom and how she treats me. I feel miserable and scared whenever she asks me to hang out or when she texts me or calls me. I feel my heart beat so fast due to my anxiety. Cutting family members out of your life isn’t a simple decision but if I’m struggling so much just to go about my day to day life because of how bad my mother treats me, is that enough to tell her I wish to not talk to eachother anymore? Or if there a better way to go about things? Please keep in mind, I’ve talked to her thousands of times about how I feel and she acts like she cares and it’s back to square one the next day..

I [30F] get weirdly sad and depressed when I visit family or places I used to live,"I'm currently visiting my brother, the only person in the family who isn't toxic and is easy to get along with.

Every time I visit family or somewhere that reminds me of all the places I used to live as a child, I get this weird sadness or depression.

I've moved a lot in my life. My parents would move us around every few years. I've had many friends that I've had to say goodbye to. We lived in three different countries with different cultures which I know very well of annd consider myself lucky to have been involved in.

I moved to the Netherlands 8 years ago. I consider the person I was before moving there a completely different one to who I am now. I moved from a toxic environment to a loving one and have become someone I could 't possibly imagine. I'm very proud of myself.

Now, when I visit my family, I start remembering everything I've had to leave, all the people I've abandoned. Old friends I'll never see again. I start mourning everything. It makes things really difficult. I'm scared to face the old me, the depressed me who had no identity and only did what I was told and thought I could never be anything than what my parents have become (nothing I envy, with all due respect). It also leads me to feel like my life in NL is so very fragile, that I could lose everything in an instant and become that old person again.

I just wish I could visit without all this stuff coming up...

I just needed to vent and try to process my emotions as I write. I am going to start EMDR soon and am getting help for my poor little troubled mind.

"I work on a Mental Health Unit, a patient of mine was sexually assaulted and my bosses are covering it up. Need help","So as the title states I work on a mental health unit in northern Alabama. I’ve been here for almost 6 years but with this organization for close to 10. They’ve done some really horrible things that I’ve witnessed and wanted to come out about but HIPAA and the fear of no one caring stopped me. This past week however, we had a female 30yo admitted to the unit with intense psychosis, she suffered a head trauma after a car accident which resulted in her brain being atrophied. Someone from my work left their post and the woman had s*x with another male patient. We know this because it was all on video as she was in a camera or CVO room. The woman is not in her right mind by any means. In psych we have what’s called orientation levels to determine how well a patient is perceiving reality. There’s 4, person (who you are who others are) place( where your at) time (the year and week and day) and situation (understanding why they are there). This woman does not meet any of these. She is medically unable to make decisions for herself. The male patient was alert and oriented. I thought it was just a horrible thing but then I discovered that they’re withholding that information from her and her family. It’s not in her chart. We’ve been asked not to speak about it. And there have been no follow up investigations, lab work, or even rule changes done in relation to this incident. The part that eats me alive more than anything is the thought of this young girl leaving this place without ever knowing what someone did to her in that state of mind. I’m torn, I want to tell someone like her family as she is still extremely psychotic at the moment, but the information may damage them more than it helps. And not only that I’m not sure how I would even go about doing it. I’ve seen this place do a lot of evil things.

"My Brother Threatens Suicide When He’s in Trouble, and I Don’t Know How to Help","Hey guys, this is a long one, so thanks for reading.

My brother (16M) and I (17F) have always been close, but over the past few years, he’s been getting into trouble—petty drama, one run in with the law, and being disrespectful at school. My parents have let a lot of his behavior slide, and at this point, it hurts his ego to admit when he’s wrong and he refuses to do so, only making excuses for his behavior.

Honestly, if it weren’t for the threats, I wouldn’t be as worried. He’s not doing anything extreme—just typical teenage boy nonsense. All his friends act the same way. But every time he gets in trouble, he threatens to kill himself—not to my parents, only to me and my sister. His latest was over my parents making him apologize in person to a teacher he disrespected. He texted me saying he will kill himself if he has to apologize. 

I can tell he’s struggling deep down, but I don’t know how much of this is genuine and how much is just him trying to get out of consequences. Either way, it’s exhausting. Our home life can be messy, and I’ve struggled with depression myself. Therapy has helped me a lot, but we live in a rural, conservative town where mental health is really stigmatized. My brother refuses to get help because he thinks therapy is stupid. No matter what I say, he won’t even consider it.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. His selfishness and disrespect are draining, but this constant fear that he might actually follow through on his threats is even worse. I feel like I’ve tried everything to get him to open up, but he just doesn’t care. I don’t know how to help him when he refuses to help himself, and I don’t want to keep carrying this weight alone.

Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks for reading.",mentalhealth,,Trouble,36.0015926,-105.5298903
Country with the best mental health care?,"
Given my naturally curious mind, I recently researched which country has the best mental health care system in the world. Unsurprisingly, Sweden often ranks highly in this regard. Having had personal experiences with Sweden’s mental health services, I can attest that while the system is indeed strong, there is always room for improvement.  

In Sweden, involuntary inpatient care falls under LPT (*Lag om psykiatrisk tvångsvård*), which translates to the ""Law on Psychiatric Compulsory Care."" This represents the highest level of intervention, alongside outpatient treatment options. My own encounters with this system both involuntary inpatient care and outpatient services have given me a nuanced perspective on its strengths and limitations. Despite Sweden’s global reputation for excellence in mental health care, like any system, it is not without its challenges.  

This leads me to wonder: How does mental health care operate in your country or state?Whether it’s involuntary care protocols, outpatient support, or general accessibility, I’d love to hear about your experiences or insights. After all, understanding different systems can help us recognize global progress and identify areas for growth.  

Looking forward to a thoughtful and respectful discussion!

"Serious question, how’s your mental health?","Hi Everyone, my name is Lamon and I’m a Certified Life Coach and Certified in Mental Health. 

First, I would like to thank the moderators for welcoming me in the community, I ensure you all that I only provide impactful and influential content to help others over their mental boundaries, challenges and limitations for the result of maximizing others full potential, but most importantly helping them get where they want, need and desire to be mentally. 

Nevertheless, I would love to offer my full heart filled support to those who could benefit from it. No, I’m not selling a service or promoting a product, Im just operating in my life’s purpose and that’s helping others. 

Myself has gone through the vigorous and treacherous battles of mental health myself. From losing over 100 friends to gun violence in Chicago, two deceased daughters, seeing a 8-year-old boy get shot in front of me and helped save his life, from homelessness to experiencing the true core of depression, I’ve had to pick myself up through healing from my trauma as much as I can and redefining my purpose to get to next level mentally by realizing that life isn’t about what I go through, but it’s about overcoming what I been through!! 

Nevertheless, if you’re reading this, I know you’re an overcomer! You’re awesome, you’re amazing and YOU GOT THIS! ",mentalhealth,,Chicago,41.8755616,-87.6244212
letting go,"Everyone I’ve ever lost has always tried to come back. And for a long time, that fed my ego—knowing I’m someone who’s hard to leave forever. I’ve never turned anyone away… until today.

Oh Lord, I am healed.

I accepted the apology. I know I’ll eventually forgive because that’s who I am. But welcoming someone back into my life without certainty that they won’t leave again? I can’t do that. My mental health needs me. My self-worth is higher than ever.

I’m so grateful, and I just wanted to share this life-changing moment.

Thinking outside of the box,"I'm 51 years old with mental health conditions that put me well past my expiration date. For the most part, listening to that MD at the medical clinic at my university in my early 20's put me in this situation. The SSRIs that were foisted on me either brought out or caused what I'm dealing with now. While I suspect that this was the overall design to ensure that I stay a lifelong customer of pharmaceutical companies and health service providers, this is, of course, speculation. Years of therapy and switching meds have only made the situation worse. I still have responsibilities that I have to tend to. While ketamine injections, EMDR, and other alternative therapies have been kind of effective, it hasn't been enough. Any other suggestions from those who don't prescribe medications by default?",mentalhealth,,MD,47.2879608,28.5670941
"I lost my ability to cry, and I blame women more than men. Men’s mental health","Recently, my gf has been asking me why I don’t show emotion about difficult situations. I responded with “it’s how I was raised” which blew her mind. This was met with a follow up question about what I meant. I told her a story I am going to share here. 

When I was 4. FOUR. I was riding a mini dirt bike with a neighbor of mine. I toppled over the dirt bike and skinned my leg pretty bad. As 4 year olds do. I started to cry. I was then told by my neighbors dad, “hey bud you’re 4 now. 4 year olds don’t cry. That is for 3 year olds.” I have no hate against my friends dad, I still talk regularly with him and he is amazing. But this is where I can trace my problem back to. 

After I told her this story, my gf responded with “but that doesn’t mean you can’t show emotion.” I laughed at this and asked her “when was the last time you felt an insanely strong emotion, but didn’t cry” this was met with silence as she realized, extremely strong emotion and crying are synonymous, the same, complimentary. She then asked “well what do you do instead of crying, that pain has to go somewhere.” I proceeded to explain that for her, crying is her outlet, but for me distracting myself is the way I get rid of feelings. I told her “eventually I avoid the feelings long enough until they fade away until they aren’t as painful, then and only then, I can address them.” She told me “you know you can come to me with anything right? I will love you no matter what.” I just nodded and said thank you. 

Little does she know the last 5 partners I have been with have said the same thing. Word for word, bar for bar, the same. Yet they “didn’t want to hear a sob story.” And if I actually got to open up about my emotions, they were used as a weapon later on. 

In a later conversation that same night. My partner asked when the last time I cried was. I told her the last time I remembered crying was when my childhood dog died… in fourth grade. I was 10, and I am 20 now. She was appalled by the fact that I don’t remember shedding a tear in a decade and asked “why would you do that to yourself.” I just said “because it’s easier. It’s the world that we live in I just have to accept it.” I didn’t have the heart to tell her that while men may have created this world of emotionless guys, the women of the world are the ones that uphold it.

While men may say “don’t cry” women shame those who do have the courage to cry. Men say “don’t open up, it’s best if it stays inside” and they mean it. They believe it with everything they have. Women on the other hand say “you can trust me, tell me, open up” yet don’t respect the man who does open up as much as they respect the man who doesn’t.

 I realize I’m generalizing but you can’t say “a few bad apples” because I have had 6 mid-long term partners(6+ months) and all 5 of my exes have used my emotions against me. This is too many people for it to be a coincidence. So I am done with this “opening up” because every time I do I get hurt. And every time, it hurts more and more and more.

Teenage mental health,"Hello everyone, i’ll be completely honest I’ve never posted on this app before so forgive me if i’ve broken any guidelines or anything.

I’m a 16 years old guy and i’ve been just feeling generally unwell in my head for the past months i have this constant feeling of not being able to think about my own future and instead i keep having these visions i simply may not be here in a few years time. I have 3 jobs all of which can be pretty stressful and i work quite a lot 

My home life isn’t particularly great my parents are fueled by alcohol and money and over the years have developed less care for me. it’s now at the point where I’m struggling to remember the last time we ever had dinner downstairs or simply the last time we left the house together to go somewhere as a family.

I’ve never really been a very emotional person but over the past few weeks i’ve been making up these crazy scenarios in my head and then i can’t seem to tell whether they are real or not.

I get anxious about the smallest things such as going to the shop at the top of my road or walking into the high-street when schools finished and i know it’s going to be busy.

I have friends but over the years i’ve found myself cutting down the amount to the point where i have quite a small circle. 

This isn’t what i would’ve pictured 2 years back as i was the louder type in school with loads of friends and a very big social life.

What kind of in-person and private help can I get in the UK since my parents do not believe in mental health issues, especially at my age, as they think I have nothing to stress about?",mentalhealth,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525
Wanting to start over,"Mostly need to vent here. I feel like I'm being held back. I lost my mother about a year ago to a rare neurological disease. I witnessed her death, helped with the home hospice care. She sometimes couldn't recognize me, and could be a completely different person - aggressive. I still have some PTSD from it. It hit dad hard. I've never really had a good relationship with my father. Dad yells at me out of the blue but does apologize... sometimes. Mom was the glue. 

My oldest sibling I get along with but does drugs and has high expectations of me, wants me to make a lot of money, or become famous. Her fiance agrees, and brings up ideas on me to do work that could help me achieve more money. Note that the fiance doesn't even work. My other sibling has put themselves in a pretty bad situation and got back with a crappy ex. 

My childhood friend that I hang out with hides behind me a lot when it comes to stressful situations. He talks about politics sometimes, and I don't feel all that comfortable when we talk about it. I'm multi-racial, and he starts parroting these extreme right wing talking points. He has never been like this before - I've known him my entire life. My other childhood friend has turned into a egomaniac trainwreck, and can't hold a job, and bought a house, hoping I'll chip in. My best college friend passed away from brain cancer. 

I'm working a tech company where layoffs have become frequent. I'm taking a class that I have enjoyed and could eventually lead to a job, but it adds more to my plate of things to do. My current boss is kind of ""eh"". I have a new client from HELL. Additionally, my old boss of 5 years pretty much ghosted me after since she approached me about a job at her place. Ouch. 

Then, my dating life. I'm aging (30), and I've honestly only had one person where I felt they genuinely loved me. The dating pool SUCKS in my area. The dates have gone no where, or they live 2 hours away from me. I hope I can experience that feeling again. 

Obviously, me getting a new job and moving to a new place has potential to blow up in my face, but there are things (or people) here that weigh me down. I also despise my apartment living situation. My neighbors are pretty rude. They get loud and I work remotely, and sometimes wake me up, not letting me sleep. The landlord has done nothing, and same thing with the cops. I realize moving could amplify or diffuse this problem. 

Just ""UGGGHH"" lol. I try to treat myself, but life is all too expensive and time is short. My grief comes and goes. I do have good online gaming friends, but I very rarely have time for it. Feels good to write it all out, though. And my neighbors can't hear me whine & moan hah.

Am I not crazy for wanting a change? Should I take new things on slower? ",mentalhealth,,HELL,42.4347571,-83.9849477
Feel worthless and as if ive lost my 2nd battle with PTSD and depression,"Typing as a way to try and calibrate my mind. My depression issues are back in full effect and are as bad as they were in 2017 when i attempted to end my life.

Lately, i feel like ive changed. Ive lost my ability to stay composed and calm. I randomly get angry and lash out at my spouse (who does not deserve it). I continue to have night terrors and nightmares that has this evil voice telling me im worthless and must end my life. I try to avoid sleep cause of it.

 I have no friends and the only family i have that talk to me are my parents, who my father subjected me to years of emotional and physical abuse due to alcoholism(which caused and led to a PTSD diagnosis) (age 3-15) and constantly yells at me to tell me im ruining his life by asking to borrow money when i have no money to eat. (I moved out on my own years ago) and my mom who only calls me to talk about how proud she is of my younger brother.


The only good thing that has happened to me this year is us getting a new apartment. That quickly became a nightmare as the above tenant is so loud, it spiraled my depression out of control and causes PTSD attacks.

I feel like the world has closed in on me and im hopeless. I just want my suffering to end. I have no self worth. I hate who i am. I cant afford proper help and the psychiatrist who they did provide to me has used me as a lab rat and keeps giving me different meds, all of which have caused liver issues (medically diagnosed) worse depression and created an agry side of me.

I just wish and pray i will stop suffering. I can hardly afford to eat anymore and cant even afford different meds. Im so scared and feel empty inside. I cant handle another battle like i endured in 2017.

The myth is Canada offers free health care and help but the care you get for free is nothing more than people who wont let you open up and instead push meds on you. I even had a therapist tell me im selfish for ever considering suicide. 

I used to be able to call my Uncle to help me, but he unfortunately passed away in last January. He was the man who acted like a real father to me from day one. No one else cares about me it seems.

This is me venting and also crying out for help. I dont know how much fight is left in me. Im only 32 and feel like my life is over. To finish, i was diagnosed with PTSD, severe anxiety, Severe depression and ADHD.

I think I recognize the path I must take going forward,"I’ve made several dark posts on Reddit over the past few days. You can see them on my profile if you’re interested lol. But now I recognize what I need to do. 

The path to read The Way of Kings beyond chapter 37. The path to read fantasy I want to experience like The Stormlight Archive, Harry Potter, Camp Half-Blood, The Lord of the Rings, Realm of the Elderlings, Red Rising, Kingkiller, The First Law, The Dresden Files, The Dark Tower, Malazan, Chronicles of the Avatar, A Song of Ice and Fire, The Wheel of Time etc. 

To reread Mistborn. To read Wildbow’s series and whatever other web serials. Webnovels. Smaller scale fantasy. 

Chinese or Greek epics. Whatever else I can think of.

The path to read sci-fi like Animorphs, Foundation, Dune, The Expanse etc. To understand the cosmere’s prophecies. To read therapy and self help books. To read horror, comics, manga. Or watch anime AND cartoons. To understand the HEART and SPIRIT of Islam, and perhaps the HEART and SPIRIT of other religions. 

And to READ and DO everything else I dream of.

I believe I shouldn’t take a path made of one or two choices. I should take a path of many choices. I was too paralyzed between two choices that I never considered a path that stretches a third choice. Or a path that considers MANY choices.

Perhaps I will never see the sure question in my life. But I KNOW the general choice I must take…

Perhaps I stopped at chapter 37 of The Way of Kings because I was so worried about the dark paths Kaladin, Dalinar, Shallan and Jasnah, and perhaps Roshar itself were going through. Or of my own future. And that was a mistake. I just spent the entire day of Eid thinking about everything I could. College, the value of my future accounting degree, the value of a degree in general. The job values obtained by associates, bachelors, and grad school. But… I think Eid is ending with me realizing the value of life is not about money, power, fame, intrigue, or status. 

Life is only as valuable as the PEOPLE we interact with. 

The path forward to reading The Way of Kings and WHATEVER ELSE without focusing on the wrong things. Without breaking my mind. I will try to go out and interact with PEOPLE, instead of being scared of PEOPLE. Perhaps this is the path to reading the rest of the cosmere, reading whatever fantasy and sci-fi my heart desires, understanding the heart of Islam and perhaps other religions. The path of understanding holy texts. The path to read good books. 

There is one and many. There is fate and predestination, but there is ALSO free will and choice. There is honor AND dishonor. Emotion and calm. And perhaps the question of WHAT is TRUE honor and emotion 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

Maybe this is the first step towards not fearing Islam, Prophet Muhammad, or Allah. Towards loving them.

Maybe this is the first step towards truly understanding the Knights Radiant and their oath

i need help.,"(this is pretty long but i am DESPERATE!) hello, i am a 15 year old girl struggling. they say that the first step to recovery is to admit that you need help, but that didnt get me anywhere.

ive realized how narcissistic and egoistical i can be, constantly manipulating and putting others down. 

sometimes when i get very bored, i lead on guys i dont give a single shit about just for fun. i dont know why, but it gives me a sense of satisfaction and i am sorry that i am not sorry at all. i love all the attention until thei start annoying be or they are not entertaining me enough so i switch to somone else.

i even like to refer to them as my ""victims"".

i know you might think im too young to say thing, but i did fall in love once and i was severely depressed and miserable. now i feel mostly numb. before, i used to have that ""fire"" in me. now, that rage only finds me sometimes when somone really pisses me off after ive been holding it all in.

on top of all that, i have an eating disorder. no, i do not wanna get better. i love it, all of it. when people point out my sickly pale skin and how my bones are showing. the random bruising it causes and my shaky hands when i pull yet another clump of hair from my head. the severe anemia that worsened with it and being so weak i cant even walk up a set of stairs.

this is a lot to take in but i just have to say it. i get thoughts about unaliving people. like actually planning a murder and carrying out. and a lot of the times i crave human flesh. it started out as raw flesh cravings, i ate raw chiken once when i was 10. it was so good, but it upset my stomach. i fantasizs about bathing in blood and other stuff like that and the urge to kill is getting stronger by day. i love watching animals turn taxidermy figures and i am fascinated by the killer mind and human body. 

yes, i do have some childhood trauma like my dad not being present and my mom being absent because she was busy with work. i was raised by my grandma until the age of 7 or 8 i think, in a traditional orthodox household. even so, something caused me to grow somewhat wrong from the rest of my family. to develop differently. i feel like a complete stranger and sometimes i have to pinch myself to realize that this is actually true, not just a dream and that this is my actual life. 

i dont know what to do. lately, it feels like my mental health worsened and i dont know how to ask my mom for a therapist. she can be very difficult sometimes and it frustrates me. if you read everything till here, thank you. and i would take anya advice.",mentalhealth,,anya,41.9241495,1.1065082
Need UK Psychiatrist for Military Exemption Letter (Turkey) - Any Affordable Options?,"Looking for a Psychiatrist for Military Exemption Letter – Need Advice

Hi everyone,

I need urgent help finding a psychiatrist in the UK who can provide a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and a formal letter to support my exemption from military service in Turkey.

The letter needs to confirm:

My ADHD diagnosis and past mental health struggles (including depression, anxiety, ).

My vulnerability due to these conditions, making me unfit for military service.

I've reached out to several organizations, including Psychiatry UK, Clinical Partners, and Mind.org, among others. While these organizations offer services, they primarily focus on talking therapies or connecting individuals with psychologists and therapists. Private psychiatrists, like those I contacted, charge around £1,000 for assessments, which is unaffordable. Furthermore, these assessments tend to be general and don't necessarily address my specific vulnerabilities and needs. My GP is unable to provide the necessary referral letter, and therapy alone isn’t sufficient. I require a comprehensive psychiatric assessment to formally diagnose and understand my condition

The fact that I am gay, which is one of the legal grounds for exemption in Turkey.

I haven’t been to Turkey in seven years due to fears for my safety. Given the political climate and strong homophobia in the Turkish military, I would be at serious risk if forced to serve. My mental health issues, combined with this environment, make me extremely vulnerable.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or know of a psychiatrist in the UK (preferably affordable) who could help? Any advice or recommendations would mean a lot.

We had been treating it as ASD as was perceived from last diagnosis, but it has come to be seen after my psychologists opinions on me that it could be much worse that high functioning autism. The other illness they are looking is Bipolar type Il, which between you and me would be so much better than a NPD diagnosis.

"I’ve tried nearly every psychiatric med out there, and none of them work. I honestly don’t think there’s anything left.","I’m 26 and have been struggling for years with severe mental health issues—diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD), chronic anxiety, panic, treatment-resistant depression, anhedonia, and obsessive rumination. My life feels like a constant loop of stress, despair, and emotional pain.

I’ve gone through what feels like the entire psychiatric pharmacy, and nothing has helped me long-term. Most things either made me worse or numbed me out until I was a zombie. The only exception was Rexulti, which gave me one day of relief—a glimpse of motivation, reduced rumination, and a sense of peace I hadn’t felt in years. But after that, it turned into a complete nightmare: severe insomnia, agitation, rage, overstimulation, and emotional volatility. I’ve been taking sedatives like Xanax, Clonidine, and Lunesta, and even they can’t calm me down on Rexulti…

Here’s a rough list of everything I’ve tried:
Antidepressants: SSRIs, SNRIs, Wellbutrin, Trazodone, etc. — either ineffective or made me numb, irritable, more anxious, or even worse physical side effects. 
Antipsychotics: Abilify, Seroquel, Vraylar (initially good, then turned me into a lifeless husk), and Rexulti (see above)
Mood stabilizers: Gabapentin, Doxepin, Topiramate, Lamictal— nothing worked, some caused serious side effects. 
Stimulants: Currently on Adderall XR and IR, helps a little with functioning but doesn’t touch the depression or anhedonia. 
NMDA support: Memantine (currently at 21mg) — subtle benefits but not enough. 
Benzos and sleep meds: also currently on Xanax, Clonidine, Lunesta — they’ve been really helpful helpful but since starting Rexulti they’re now starting to lose effectiveness

I’ve tried therapy. I’ve tried routine. I’ve tried lifestyle changes. I even looked into ketamine, but haven’t been able to access it yet. TMS and VNS are off the table—I’m not interested in those. I’m not even sure I want to try lithium, though it seems like the only “option” left on paper.

At this point, I genuinely feel like there are no more meds left to try. And that’s a terrifying realization. I’m angry. I’m tired. I’m heartbroken. I’m barely hanging on, and I don’t know what else to do.

If anyone has been through this level of medication burnout and found something that actually worked—whether it was a med, off-label treatment, or some unconventional combo—I’m open to hearing it. Because right now, it seriously feels like I’m out of options.",mentalhealth,,VNS,25.4509975,82.86359940219003

Psychiatrist told me I was “giving up” but couldn’t have been more wrong,"This’s a story from a while back and while I can laugh at it now, it definitely affected me at the time.

I was 15/16 at the time and had an ongoing struggle with suicidal ideation/attempts, self harm and ongoing trauma symptoms that were impacting me deeply. At the time I was diagnosed with C-PTSD and suspected to have autism/ADHD (now diagnosed with both).
I saw two services, one being a private psychologist and the other being CAMHS which is a public mental health service for people under 18 that provides more acute care.

My psychologist was great, she suggested that maybe instead of being thrown on an arrange if SSRIs it may be worth looking at a longer term alternative. She suggested a few ideas, one being an assistance dog/AD (or service dog for Americans). I went home and looked into what an AD could do to help someone in my situation and it seemed promising. Having a dog actively involved in tasking and helping gain independence to take control of my life seemed like a logical approach given how long symptoms persisted.

So after talking about it in depth at our next appointment I took the idea to my psychiatrist at CAMHS. He was so closed off to the idea especially given the fact I was saying that I think medication isn’t helpful and not viable long term. The dude told me that I’d be “giving up” to get an AD and it’s an “easy way out.” Now for anyone who has or knows someone with an AD you know it is a lot of work and it certainly isn’t easy. For him to make this claim was extremely ignorant.

22 years old now and have an AD, he’s a gorgeous 2 year old Labrador who’s still got some training to complete but has made a massive positive impact on my life. I started having multiple inpatient admissions a year ranging from 1-2 weeks but since I’ve had him I’ve had two. He motivates me to wake up, go outside, follow a healthy routine and he gives me a sense of purpose and accomplishment. On some hard days he has easily saved me from myself and I am on far less medication now. Bottomline, he makes me actively try to better my life. It feels good to have proven that asshole doctor wrong and my team now adore my boy and commend us both for how much better my life has become.
This has been so far from giving up, it’s been the push I needed to get up and make my life better. ",mentalhealth,,Labrador,55.0,-69.0

Partners of Bipolar,"Is there support for spouses of bipolar? I had no understand nor idea bipolar presented like this. When we met I thought ""wow this guy loves and adores me so much, he is so nice and caring!"" Years later I found  that as he was trying to date me he would pick up prostitutes. His stories change all the time, so I never know which version to believe. He is in a manic state most of the time. Blows through money, he cleared all our savings to buy a used car we didn't need. When his business needed a surge of income he convinced  me to take a huge loan in my name-at the same time he brought in secret a business partner - who took everything and split. At 11 pm Husband lets our cat in n himself out. Walked barefoot 12 miles to his mothers. Shocked  I scrambled  to keep a roof over  2 kids and my very pregnant head. Left me in 500k debt ( that his buddy stole) a home going into foreclosure and me in high risk pregnancy. During that episode he also tried to buy a 2 million dollar property while not even having 20 dollars on him.  drinking binges to his buddies who had single women available  - while I was home with a newborn.  he also again disappeared while just going to the store to get cigarettes - didn't show signs of life for weeks. the lies and manipulations are endless. There is no reciprocity, accountability,  responsibility. Recently I found a mini dress, hoop earrings in his underwear drawer and a womens belt. His grand delusions of me having contact with men, work as an excuse - while reality had me ear deep in kids, bills, life zero time left over. He makes sure he throws enough problems at me that I am kept busy. His many online dating sites keep emailing  matches.Last week I found a text from local # on his fake phone number app ""how much to f*ck""  I brought that us in our couples therapy,  but it didn't get addressed, his answer was it was me that has talked to a man 14 years ago on the phone for an hour and a half ! Which the therapist referred to ""excessive ""  Therapy where his delusions are met with support and a valid screenshot of a untasteful proposal is met with ignorance.  The insidious constant behavior is of a 3 year old on a continuous tamper tantrum that describes my husband fairly well. unhappy angry, always  at me or  kids. He refuses help or medication... my idea of sense of a happy family that laughs together has dissolved. humor on my partner has diminished to me hoping he won't be in a fighting mood. The older he got the harder it is   Sometimes he levels off. That's when I breathe.He fuels himself and self medicates with my sons ADHD meds, or prescriptions his father shared with him, a bottle he found prescribed for my kidney infection, Redbulls and other energy drinks... He is always sensitive,  and when truly manic he screams  to me that my voice is annoying and no one is allowed to speak. He had violent episodes he didn't remember and never felt empathetic or sorry for. Had attempts at his own life hospitalized,  I got attacked by his mother and sister who blamed me for it, they don't believe in mental illness.Consequences of his actions always catching up to me cleaning the messes he would leave in his wake. Is there help for exhausted, used up, crumpled up messes like me?",mentalhealth,,Husband,40.0417436,-79.1016949

Zero mental health," I don’t know if this matters, but I just needed to put it out there.

I don’t know when it all started. Maybe I was born this way, or maybe life just kept pushing me down until I stopped trying to get back up.

I don’t really know why I’m posting this. Maybe I just want someone to hear me, even if it’s just strangers on the internet. Maybe I just want to know that I’m not the only one who’s felt like this.


I wrote something—a story, I guess—but it’s really just my life disguised as fiction. I put everything I’ve felt into it. The loneliness, the feeling of never being enough, the way people leave like you were never important to them in the first place. If any of that makes sense to you, maybe this will too.

Here’s part of it:


---

I was supposed to be a gift from God. That’s what my name meant—Mathew. A name my parents chose with so much hope, believing I’d grow into something great. But if I was a gift, I must’ve been the kind that no one wanted. The kind that gets pushed to the back of the shelf, forgotten.

I was never the smartest. Never the best-looking. Never the guy people noticed in a room. Just there. A glitch in the system, a face in the crowd, a brown-skinned boy too skinny to be attractive, too awkward to be likable, too dumb to be successful.

But they still expected things from me. My parents, my teachers—hell, even I used to expect things from myself. In India, grades matter more than gold, and I was supposed to bring honor to my family. But no matter how hard I tried, I could never be enough. The numbers on my report card never matched their dreams, and with each passing year, I saw the hope in my parents’ eyes fade.

They never said I was a disappointment. But every time I brought home a bad grade, I saw it in their faces—the silent way my mom sighed, the way my dad would go quiet at the dinner table. And worse than that, I saw the way others judged them. In this country, when a kid fails, it’s never just the kid’s fault. It’s the parents’. The whispers, the pitying looks, the relatives offering “advice” on how to fix me—it was like they were being punished for having a son like me. And I hated that.

And then there was her.

---

I didn’t want to make this post too long, so I stopped here. But if anyone wants to read the rest, let me know.

I don’t expect anything from this. I just wanted to put it out into the world. If you’ve ever felt like this, just know that you’re not alone. And if you have thoughts, I’d love to hear them.",mentalhealth,,India,22.3511148,78.6677428
All alone always,"I sit alone daily with my intrusive thoughts and depression. I constantly wait desperately for someone anyone to txt or call me, but day after day nothing. It pathetic how little people care about me, knowing what I’m going through. Meds don’t help just make me worse, doc doesn’t see urgency in fixing my meds. No one cares if I’m around. The one person that could save me and end all this anxiety and depression I dare not tell for she suffers enough and would be selfish to dump my mental health stuff on her. Even she doesn’t really txt me and never calls and I only see her when there is money involved. No one needs me unless they want something, bc no one really cares. This can’t keep going on like this. Everyday is a nightmare wrapped in a haze of depression and anxiety. I’ve tried for so long. And now the one glimpse of hope I’ve had in my life is out of reach. I don’t want to do this anymore. What is the point? ",mentalhealth,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
Burnouts and Mood Swings,"Hi.  I wasn't sure who to reach out to but I just wanted to make a post about how I'm feeling recently. 

  
I read an article recently that there have been an increase of Gen Z (18-28) who have been experiencing burnouts. I've been experiencing quite a lot of it and the ""adults"" (above the age 30) around me have just told me that I'm just overreacting or making excuses. Some of it is understandable, since I've had ""mood swings"" from time to time as a child. But sometimes I would just want to end it all, not do anything or just disappear. 

I've read blogs that say that I should seek support (at my job) but that doesn't really seem the best for my situation since they've told me once before that everyone experiences these things and it's my choice to overcome it or not. Nothing about how or anything but I guess that's what adulting is. 

I was born and raised in Japan, still work and live in Japan so all this mental health stuff is—as you may or may not know—swept under the rug. Which is another reason I haven't even had a diagnosis for ADHD since my parents just tell me I'm making excuses for myself being so incompetent. I feel ashamed to even talk about it with the people living with me. The stress of making a living when everything is so expensive, inflation yada yada, wanting to settle, to marry but being socially awkward, I don't really know how to bond with people. 

I apologize this has gone on and on but I just wanted to ask...From a redditor, to another redditor, are you feeling the same? Burnouts? Mood swings? I'm not really looking for anything inspirational. ",mentalhealth,,Japan,36.5748441,139.2394179

Unhappy with my current life,"(28M) I’m autistic (high-functioning) and have OCD and depression, with undiagnosed anxiety. I’ve had a long, hard road socially and developmentally. I’m relatively lean and think I look decent, but I never got more than a short fling when I was 21 (ironically when I looked much worse). No relationships. I’ve been in college for a long time (now online) and have had to work full-time. The worst part is that I live in a small town in a southern state and can’t yet afford to move out from my grandmother’s house. She’s so obsessed with religion and expects me to be enthusiastically religious with her, despite me never praying or showing interest in attending church. Thankfully, I’m making quick progress with my program and anticipate finishing this summer, so I’ll be able to leave this dreadful region for a large northeastern city this fall. But I still feel so down. So many people my age have had great relationships, numerous vacations, and great jobs. And so many people on Reddit seem to live in advanced, liberal US cities. It’s unfair because it’s easier to afford to live in such cities if you start in them like all these people do. And my family always disregards my feelings about this area and what I want in life (no kids, to live in a large northeastern city). And there’s no way to make friends here, it’s very clique-based.

So I’m behind on social life, dating, and living in an acceptable locale of the US. And I’m more or less stuck with a backward family. Will life get better for me when I move to a large northeastern city? Obviously it won’t automatically fix itself by me moving there. But there are so many ways to meet cool people who I share interests with in those cities, not everyone is married by 24, there’s a diverse job market, and there’s an endless array of things to see and do there. Will my life get better if I move to one of these cities and put myself out there with people?",mentalhealth,,US,39.7837304,-100.445882

I spoke up about suicidal thoughts and nothing happened,"I 27M have been going through a difficult period in work for years. The last 9 months have been absolute hell for my mental health, to the point where the stress and burnout has turned into crippling anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I don't want to go into too much details about the history of it, the only thing worth noting is I have always struggled with anxiety. 

My family has always known about my anxiety and despite not being able to offer any actual support, they have always been respectful and acknowledged it. My work only started to find out when the requests they were asking were causing me significant distress, so I got referred to occupational health which fully detailed my condition, challenges and what support I need. This was 14 months ago, and believe it or not, my workload actually increased after this despite me asking for support. This caused a crash about 9 months ago, a serious crash. My mental health became debilitating, and I felt trapped. I put all my efforts into looking at alternative roles within the company which better support this. 

Fast forward 8 months, 9 interviews later, and I've had no success. I raised a grievance too, which was dealt with unfairly so I withdrew it. I asked for support because I needed it, nothing was done. 

Two and a half weeks ago, I handed a sick note in for 2 weeks and came clean to my boss about the full picture and detailed it in an email. I said I was struggling with bad suicidal thoughts, my wife is worried sick, and I feel utterly trapped. He was kind, compassionate, and supportive. He phoned me the next day with what I thought sounded like good news, he said he has spoken to his manager and they want to redeploy me, and help me out. 

Fast forward another week, someone even more senior denied this request. I am going back on Monday, nothing has changed, and someone senior in my company clearly has a succession plan where I remain exactly where I am and anywhere else I am no use. 

Now before anyone points out that companies are only required to make adjustments that are ""reasonable"", I know this. This company is in the UK, employs more than 40k employees, and moves lots of people about all the time for far less severe circumstances. Just recently, they have advertised 2 positions with the exact same job title as mine but in a much better team externally. I actually said to my employer these would help me, as it's a more relaxed work pace, and the requests are not as unreasonable and it would allow me to heal. Additionally, I am fully competent and able to mentor. They done nothing. 

It seems as though my role, which before I came had people leaving almost immediately, is hard to fill, and they are therefore trapping me in the role. I appreciate I could apply external, but that has its own challenges.i also can't just quit and take some time off because I have a mortgage etc. 

Why even bother speaking up about mental health if no one who can help will help? I feel stupid for telling my work I had suicidal thoughts. I feel cheated about all these seminars etc about mental health where it says to speak up. I feel like it's all a lie. What can anyone do to actually help me if it's work related and the work won't help?",mentalhealth,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525
Will I be tired for the rest of my life?,"Bullying, dad walking out, emotional abuse from my grandmother, endless issues and problems until the end of high school, mother getting cancer and dying, suicidal ideation, depression, substance dependency, self harm, anxiety, CPTSD and ADHD. All of this before I turned 20 years old. I'm 26 now.

I've been in therapy for 5 years, there's nothing from the past that hasn't been worked through. I have meds that work and keep me stable. I take vitamins and my bloodwork is A+ according to my doctor. But I am. So. Tired. 

I spend majority of my time like I did when I was a teenager skipping school - curled up in a blanket, watching Netflix. I have a few days of productivity here and there when I can do 8h+ of work, cleaning, running errands. All other times I have to FORCE myself to do something. Anything. Even things I really, really end up enjoying. That is if I manage to get myself up. Once I sit down, during any part of the day, the exhaustion hits like a thousand bricks and I can't get up again. My adhd meds can keep me on a task and things are easier to start, my mind feels so much better and positively motivated, but again, my body drags me down. It convinces me I can't do it, that I am too tired. I have no problem bed rotting for days on end, except being emotionally distressed that I'm not doing anything. But getting up feels mentally like physical pressure on my head and all the voices keep fighting in my head ""You can do this"", ""You can't do this you're too tired"". I've had a Monday-Friday 10-18 job, a routine, didn't help. I didn't exist as a person outside of those hours, I crashed the moment I got home. Rest of the time spent recovering so I could start the new week. I'm currently unemployed since February. There are so many things in this life I wish to do, I want do, that I dream about. 

TDLR: Is my nervous system broken from trauma for the rest of my life? Was it just so shot to hell so my physical body can't keep up with me? Or am I just unconsciously still making myself a victim of the past and I'm just too weak-willed? There's people who have gone through so, so much worse, but built themselves up. They pushed through everything to become something better. Why am I not able to do that? What do I need to do to be able to push myself? I want to be better. I want to be the person who could say ""I achieved something that I really wanted"" and ""I got myself up and worked hard for this"".",mentalhealth,,Netflix,40.76376354999999,-73.97430267133896

[vent/traumadump] Afraid won’t be well enough to go ball to college for the Fall semester in August (cont. in comments),"I (21m) have been at my college for 4 semesters now. The first 3 were really hard as I dealt with the transition from an adolescence that was really sheltered and atypical and during which I transitioned off from multiple simultaneous medications on which I’d been for years that had been hurting, not helping me, which I wasn’t able to fully quit until my 3rd semester. I was suffering so much there were multiple cold turkey attempts in my earlier semesters about which my family would always find out, which I think just scrambled my brain even more but I was so desperate to not feel the way they made me feel, although they finally accepted me not being on them. 

In the 4th semester everything seemed to be turning around, I finally made this one friend (who’s really cool) and I also began talking to this girl who while ostensibly another friend I actually had mad feelings for. What’s important is that because of my sheltered, overmedicated experience growing up, this was my first real crush/object of my romantic feelings with which I was interacting, despite me being in college. However it wasn’t ok for me keep interacting with her and presenting myself as a friend because she had a partner, granted I didn’t find out about him until 3 months of talking to her, however I could have just made an effort to find out by looking at her Instagram or something and I didn’t cause she was so cool (doing like fashion and photo shoots and stuff) it was too overwhelming because it made me feel so small. 

But the combination of the happy feelings from my new friendship and getting the attention of the girl I shouldn’t have been talking to basically gave me so much hope for the first time, I got into shape and lost a massive amount of weight which was super validating and felt really good (may have gone well into ED territory sadly, going from a BMI of around 29 to 20 in 4 months), got into running which has become a huge passion for me, actually consumed media sometimes (oftentimes I won’t like watch movies, tv, play games etc. cause I had this half-conscious feeling like it was meant for “normal humans”, not me, and that I was doing something “wrong” by engaging with it, I still get a very similar feeling with social media like Insta, Snapchat, TikTok, even YouTube which makes them super stressful and overwhelming to use thus putting me at odds with many members of my generation who love to waste time on that kind of stuff, I honestly wish I could without that shameful feeling). And more then anything all of these just made me feel for the first time like I COULD catch up with all these cool college students around me developmentally, even in spite of my past of being super emotionally volatile (before my meds just made me numb for years, and also having so much anxiety, depression, asd1.

But the combination of the happy feelings from my new friendship and getting the attention of the girl I shouldn’t have been talking to basically gave me so much hope for the first time, I got into shape and lost a massive amount of weight which was super validating and felt really good (may have gone well into ED territory sadly, going from a BMI of around 29 to 20 in 4 months), got into running which has become a huge passion for me, actually consumed media sometimes (oftentimes I won’t like watch movies, tv, play games etc. cause I had this half-conscious feeling like it was meant for “normal humans”, not me, and that I was doing something “wrong” by engaging with it, I still get a very similar feeling with social media like Insta, Snapchat, TikTok, even YouTube which makes them super stressful and overwhelming to use thus putting me at odds with many members of my generation who love to waste time on that kind of stuff, I honestly wish I could without that shameful feeling). And more then anything all of these just made me feel for the first time like I COULD catch up with all these cool college students around me developmentally, even in spite of my past of being super emotionally volatile (before my meds just made me numb for years, and also having so much anxiety, depression, asd1.

Mental hospital,"Hey! 17 (F) I am thinking of admitting myself to a mental hospital in Illinois. I’ve been really considering suicide and have self harming thoughts. I have always been concerned about my looks and never leave the house w/o makeup. I was wondering if makeup is allowed in a hospital? I’ve never been, so I’m not sure what to leave at home. ",mentalhealth,,Illinois,40.0796606,-89.4337288
"Vent: Nobody really cares, do they?","Didn’t see a flair for self harm, but its mentioned.
Also sorry if my spelling is bad or it looks like I’ve had a stroke writing.

Now I might seem like the typical edgy teenager with the “ugh! Nobody understand me…”. But genuliley, even if I know people care, I feel so awfully alone.

Recently, I’ve been trying to support my friends, like I usually do, I can’t say I’m amazing at it, but my friends tell me they apriaciate it.
I’m unsure if I’ve said something wrong or done anything, but latley even though I’ve asked my friends to hang out, they tell me they’re ro exausted or don’t reply, then end up hanging together instead. 
They’re not really hiding it, so I don’t think its intentioal. But it kinda hurts.

Also recently, my father found out for the second time that I self harm, he noticed the cuts when I got to confident my shirt wouldnt expose them. He just told me it wasnt good and asked me why, then now for the past days never brought it up again. Last time he found out, he just sent me a link on how to cope in other ways, then never spoke of it again. My mother hasnt done anything either, it’s like they don’t care.
If they care, they don’t show it. I’ve shown signs of mental illness for too long now, even opening up about suecidal thoughts at 11 (I just got yelled at). I tried going to a counsler but he just told my parents everything and they got mad for causing drama I guess. 
Anyways, latley my health has been going up and down, I have friends and a better school, but I’m still pretty depressed. Also my I think I have mind fog which I’ve had for allmost a year now if so. 
I’m tired, find myseld struggling to put things into words, take care of myself, clean my room, do stuff. 

I know people care, but it doesnt feel like it sometimes. I know it might just all be in my head, but I just can’t help when I just randomly feel like I get hit with sudden feelings of sadness or emptyness, its odd, I don’t like it. 
I feel alone.

How to Handle Toxic Family While Studying?,"Hey guys,

I need some advice for a friend (F23), let’s call her Anna. She’s in a really tough situation at home, and I don’t know what more I can do to help her.

Anna lives with her mom and older sister while pursuing a five-year degree. She had a setback and got dropped for a year, but I’ve seen her working really hard to catch up. The problem is, her family doesn’t see it that way. Instead of supporting her, they constantly compare her to other people, saying things like, “Look at so-and-so, she has a job and makes money while you’re still doing nothing.” They treat her like a failure, even though she’s studying and even working part-time as a gym trainer to support herself (though the pay is very little).

Her mom does tiffin services but mostly relies on Anna’s sister, who is the main breadwinner. And honestly, her sister is the biggest asshole I've ever seen. She constantly insults Anna, calls her a waste of money, brings up finances to shame her and even verbally abuses her whenever she’s in a bad mood. No matter what Anna does, it’s never enough. She’s super careful with money, doesn’t spend unnecessarily, and is trying her best, but the negativity at home makes everything harder.

She dreams of leaving, but she loves her mom and can’t afford to live on her own right now. She knows she has to stay for at least two more years until she finishes her degree. It’s heartbreaking because she’s already struggling with studies, and this toxic environment makes it even worse. I try my best to keep her spirits up, take her mind off things, and be there for her, but I can tell it’s really wearing her down.

The worst part? I have a feeling that once Anna starts making money, her sister will suddenly start treating her nicely. But right now, she’s stuck in this cycle of being belittled every single day.

So, what would you do if you were in Anna’s situation? How do you deal with toxic family members when you have no way out just yet?",mentalhealth,,Anna,39.0204311,-0.6461361
I scream into the void about my dislike of AI art and no one can hear me and it's happening anyway,"I have migrated to other social platforms like Lemmy and Bluesky. I'm mostly active over there and slowly cultivating a digital home for myself. But I still keep this part of me here to keep in touch with my favourite communities that haven't yet migrated or that I haven't found yet in those spaces. Over on Lemmy, I looked through the community list to see where the art communities are at. There's hardly any in the [sh.itjust.works](https://sh.itjust.works) instance. But there are a fck ton of AI slop generators there. I am lead to wonder, were they made to make up for the lack of an art community? I have to assume that the majority of people that love ai gen art are folks who truly are oblivious/naive/ignorant of their actions the way we've been ignorant about so many other things, but they don't care or aren't bothered by the uncanny valley vibe. But I can't help thinking there is also in that mix, people who have a real vendetta against intellectuals or creatives, which would classify them as neo nazis. The nazis in WW2 fucking *hated* smart people and it's why they burned books and everything else that came after. 

Even if some smaller online spaces might be hostile toward human artists, I want to try to grow there anyway, otherwise we lose our voice. I just am frustrated and genuinely disturbed by the AI slop constantly being uploaded to the feed. Jesse Gender made a video essay that put into words beautifully how I feel about this, how a lot of us feel. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8xL3ol3xw8&pp=ygUPamVzc2UgZ2VuZGVyIGFp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8xL3ol3xw8&pp=ygUPamVzc2UgZ2VuZGVyIGFp) Yes, I know it's on youtube, which is not great but it is what it is. It's worth the watch. Hopefully Jesse will soon have a platform on Peertube or something but for now this is what we've got. 

Art, like any other pursuit is our livelihood. For some of us it's all we can do. I know it doesn't matter, there's nothing I can say. 

It costs nothing to make AI art. It costs nothing to be kind either.

Chronic pain and mental health in India! Feeling stuck,"For 5 years, I’ve had debilitating lower back/tailbone pain (MRI shows mild disc bulge, but doctors dismiss it) which i think can be psychomatic. I can’t sit >20 mins, walk >1 hour, or focus without exhaustion.

Tie a belt around your waist!
Don't think about the pain (they took psychosomatic pain as if it's my fault and I am in full control and end it anytime I want)!

All this makes me dismiss my suffering and stay in denial and belive that I can just go harder and escape this! Which obviously didn't worked in last 4 years and it's my fault that I didn't did enough🙂

"All I am seeing is hate, and it's affecting my mental health","I have noticed that I have become more and more distant as the world lashes out at people ( U.S. citizens ) from name calling all the way the threatening. 

I saw four people arguing recently ( I was spectating a conversation ) on my old reddit account that I am trying to distance myself from due to the fact that I had someone physically threaten me, my liberty, and my rights. 

I had to get the police involved because it got so out of control. Some people think it's funny to name call and threaten, but it's not at all. Even when the world says it's okay, it's actually not okay at all. All of this has been making me depression and anxiety act up, not to mention my PTSD. 

Some people from different countries that have begun to defend others have gotten the same ridicule or worse and it's sad. I was talking to someone yesterday, and it ended up with me getting a lot of things off of my chest. 

Right now, I'm fighting back tears..... My anxiety is telling my everything is going to end and there is nothing I can do about it. It's more or less screaming it at this point and I can't take it anymore. 

I'm trying to stay away from weed and other substances like that due to a bad episode that made me hallucinate and go numb, and that is an uphill right now as it's been only three weeks.

I do not expect anyone to talk to me, but it would be nice.

And systems that are out in place to benefit us in governments ex: healthcare, education, food system governance, are put in place to make the rich richer.

I’m not schizophrenic to the point where I’m smashing TVs or destroying my belongings 
I’m not threatening others no one fears for their life around me, but I do have issues that are preventing me from being productive member of society and possibly a danger to society. It’s not fixed soon, but no one cares. Do I seriously have to be a danger to society for everyone to actually listen to me. 

I feel ignored every time I express my issues and my problems my feelings, like no one cares enough to help me 
It’s going to take me months to get any kind of progress through counselling
And then it’s gonna take me months of psychotherapy to even get an understanding of a diagnosis and then only then when I’ve gotten a diagnosis they can start treating me they can give me medication they can figure out what’s wrong with me,


What is taking so long mental health services was quicker during the pandemic. I need somebody got a schizophrenic diagnosis. Quickly during the pandemic and he was on pills within a few months. 
And all he did was say that voices were coming from the TV that’s why he smashed it 

I throw out my belongings when I get stressed out and overwhelmed 
I say things, I don’t mean, I believe in delusional beliefs, but I keep them to myself. Do I seriously have to be the end is near guy to be taken seriously 
I seriously have to smash my belongings for people actually give a fuck about my life 

Because I’m  trying to get mental health services, but it’s just jumping through hoops after hoop after hoop after hoop that is just nothing gets helped Ever


Is that just with mental health services is jumping through hoops ",mentalhealth,,hoop,34.64512055,135.51369906103764
Just venting/looking for advice,"I (m/31) have been struggling with thoughts about self harm. Have not done any of it but the thought of doing something to myself have been increasing over the past half year or so. I know that doing something like this is not the solution to anything, but I currently cannot focus on my studies because of it. I currently study English, German and History in order to become a teacher in Germany and am close to finishing my master’s degree. I can’t really think of a time where I was not critiqued in any way by my family. Especially from the husband of my sister. He’s a teacher and even though he is middle school teacher thinks that he is the smartest person in the world and knows everything. He even refuses to accept that he is incorrect, even if the evidence points toward him being incorrect (he refused to accept that the leds from the switch controller display p1, p2 etc, and not the battery charge). Idk if I am overreacting or if I should just push through the last few exams and be done with my degree. I have postponed the final oral exam because I can’t concentrate on the material and don’t want to think about what happens if I fail. Also, if I fail, I would just be a lost cause because I would be 33 without any work experience or apprenticeship.  Nevertheless, I will start a 4-week program at a psych ward to work on my mental heath and my depressive thoughts. Well, if you’ve got any advice that helped you, I would appreciate it :)",mentalhealth,,Germany,51.1638175,10.4478313
"18M, can someone relate or help tell me what is going on?","These past couple months, I’ve felt a lot different than I used to before November. Not in any good way at all; well kinda.

I consistently imagine that my ex best friends, ex’s, or really anyone in general are obsessed with me, and I day dream about it a lot. This started around last summer. It’s to the point where, I believe it, but I question it because I wasn’t like this before. In fact, I used to be quite insecure and I lacked a lot of confidence. I still do, but I just have this superiority to others that I can’t let go of. Like, I know I’m better than the people around me, even though I flaws. I just know I’m better than them.

More recently, I’ve become a lot more aggressive lately. My boyfriend hangs out with one of my ex best friends from time to time, because they are somewhat close. And every time they hangout, I tend to leave and go home so I don’t have to be around them. But every time I do, I get so worked up that this friend is gonna try and kiss or do something with my boyfriend, and I can’t help but want to beat the shit out of— no, not the friend, but my boyfriend. I don’t know why. I just want to see his face all battered up to make him understand how I feel when he hangs out with people I don’t like. Overall, I just get agitated really fast, and the first things that come to mind are beating the shit out of them, or harming them in some way, no matter who it is. Again, this is not something I eve ever thought of or even done before while back.

Also, more recently, as in the past few weeks, I can’t stop thinking about space and the meaning of life. I’m stuck in believing that no one around me is actually real, or conscious, and I’m the only real alive thing in the universe, or, that if everyone around me is real, then I mean absolutely nothing to the other of billions of people in this world, and I need to die. I need to die if I am not known, or popular, or liked.

I have a family history with mental health, and I already have other diagnoses(OCD, depression, anxiety). Because of my age, I’m not diagnosed with bi-polar, but because of my symptoms and family history I’m currently taking a mood stabilizer, lamotrigine 100mg. I also have a history of self harm, but I’ve been clean for around half. A year now. But, I have had a lot of urges to in the past few months. Another thing that might be important is that I’ve grown up in a really rough/chaotic home; I’m a military brat and I’ve moved back to back since I was a kid, until I was about 9 when my dad got medically retired. He is an ex-addict(crack), current alcoholic, and also has a lot of mental health issues. He is and has been abusive, not necessarily physically, but 100% emotionally/verbally. He is also extremely narcissistic. Nothing big/traumatic has happened recently, besides by dad coming home wasted and aggressive, per usual.

That’s all I have; can someone help me figure what might be going on? I want to understand, because I don’t. Everything has been so sudden, and everything just doesn’t feel real anymore.",mentalhealth,,kinda,57.9946553,15.8926885
How long did it take for you to accept that panic attacks were just that 'panic attacks',"As the title says. How long and what did it take for you to accept there wasn't anything physically wrong with you.

My story in short:

I had my panic attacks emerge with a major panic attack 1,5 years ago and had them ever since. Only now I am starting to accept that it is nothing physically wrong with me.


So obviously I thought I was dying and got tested:
Holter, ecg, Heart echo, Stress test, abdominal echo, colonoscopy, Brain mri, asthma tests. Multiple visits to ER. All that was found was that I have mild fatty liver.

What made it worse for me was hearing about those odd cases where people were diagnosed with 'panic' and had something bigger going on. Of course I thought I was one of those because the symptoms were horrible.

So yeah starting to finally accept that yes the mind can trigger some big physical events.

Yeah and i'm all in on health anxiety thats causing my issues.",mentalhealth,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
An Evaluation on Male Suicides,"Suicide among men is a touchy topic for some, but coming to understand it is sometimes good for your well being. Many people I've talked to about this aren't really sure why suicide is prevalent among men, or that it's even prevalent at all. In 2019, males accounted for nearly 80% of the suicide deaths in the U.S., and suicide was the eighth leading cause of death for males, often without a known mental health condition. A study done by the National Library of Medicine revealed that through consulting with the friends and family members of these victims, stress, undiagnosed depression, abuse, and many other factors have been observed before taking their own life. This data had also stated that many of these factors are often downplayed or denied by the victim themselves. According to ""The Gendered Landscape of Suicide: Masculinities, Emotions, and Culture,"" many men commit suicide because they believe that it is a solution to their problems, or that is a method to escape their sorrows. Suicide is a long term solution for short term problems, and may seem as a good method to escape your problems, even though it's not. Many men struggle because they often do not open up to others, and don't talk to anyone. Cultural norms have taught men to silence their emotions, and be strong no matter what, and it's unfortunate. Many men refuse to open up about their emotions because they fear public ridicule. Men should be able to seek out help, and open up about what's wrong without receiving criticism. I do not condone or encourage suicide, I am just simply trying to provide insight on the truth about suicide among men.  ",mentalhealth,,U.S.,39.7837304,-100.445882
"I feel overwhelmed, devastated and indecisive. Lost my will completely to move forward.","I don't know if this post aligns with the purpose of this group but as I have been facing immense mental pressure and sinking into depression with each passing day, I am just gonna vent anyway. I am an international student currently in UK to pursue my postgrad. As I am from one of the third world countries in asia, It has been my lifelong dream to move to some developed country for a better future for myself. Although my major is immensely math heavy and I had very little exposure to math in my undergard, yet I opted for it as it's one of the most demanding subjects right now. I overestimated my capabilities and decided to do it anyway. Now 2-3 months have passed since I started this degree, I am in the worst mental state in my life so far. Everyday I attend classes and don't understand anything what the teacher and peers discuss about. I am lagging behind in the most basic concepts and failing to apply anything in advanced stages. It doesn't align with whatever I have thought it to be. I made the mistake of not going through the structures thoroughly and now I feel like a failure waking up everyday not knowing where my life's moving towards. I tried to switch  degrees but don't have that option anymore and I don't know what I am gonna switch to either. I am on a student visa and if I walk away from this, this is gonna be invalid soon. I just feel so bad for my father as he invested a big chunk of his hard earned money on this. I just can't go back to my country and face my family like a failure. I am trying to build courage but it's not enough to get through this. To complete the whole thing is well beyond my capabilities right now. No matter how hard I try, I can't get a hold of this. The workload is so much for me at this point that I had to let go my part time for this. Now I am just taking money for my family everyday for everything yet it all going in vain. For the last week it's just me sitting in my dark room and contemplating what could have been and going through panic attacks randomly. I don't wanna live on like this, I don't wanna be a disappoint to my family. I fear if I go back, it's just gonna be so many taunts from people, all those pitiful words to my failure and I forcing my family to go through this embarrassment for no reason. What to do now? I am hoping for the kind words of people who have gone through the same phase in their lives, your experience on how to get through this. I thought I had everything figured out and now I am just stuck here with no one by side, with no option to move on and suffocating under a big pile of dreams.

I still live with my parents and have no job currently after getting fired from the last 2 due to my friend I was working with. When I was younger I got into a lot of trouble but luckily avoided prison. I've had depression for as long as I remember but tried to mask this with drugs (most things apart from crack/heroin). I quit smoking actual weed at the end of last year due to it making me paranoid/lazy and replaced it with CBD. I dont do any other drugs now either and haven't for a couple of years. I feel like I've wasted so much of my life and that now I'm in a position I can't get out of. Basically dug my own grave. So what I want to ask is, is there any point in me still existing?

Mental health resources for an unemployed family member,"Hoping to pick brains here and get advice on if there are any resources for getting an adult sister, who seems to have become stagnant in life, help.

Currently she is not working (has not even applied to one job since getting laid off) does not attend social activities, lives with family member who pays the bills.

I Survived a Genocide But I Feel Nothing,"I managed to evacuate from Gaza, leaving behind the rubble, the bodies, and the memories of the war zone. You’d think getting out would bring relief, a sense of safety—but all it brought me was emptiness. I thought once I escaped, I’d be able to feel again, to grieve for the lives lost, for the people I knew. But I feel nothing.

I’m in a place far from the violence now, surrounded by people who are living normal lives. They go about their day, complaining about trivial things—traffic, their jobs, relationship problems. And I just stare at them. How do they not realize how absurd it all is? I survived hell, saw children torn apart in the streets, watched families disappear overnight, and now I’m expected to care about small talk? I don’t.

Even after I got out, people wanted me to share my story, to talk about the horrors I escaped. But every time I do, I feel detached, like I’m telling someone else’s story. I describe the destruction, the bodies, the screams, but it feels like I’m reading from a script. I can’tonnect to it anymore. It’s like I left my emotions back there, buried under the rubble.

I’ve lost all sense of empathy. When I hear about someone dying, even someone close, it doesn’t register. I didn’t cry when I found out a friend of mine didn’t make it out. I didn’t care when I heard about others losing everything. I go through the motions, pretending to sympathize, but inside, it’s just blank.

People think escaping the genocide means survival, but it’s not true. Part of me died there, and the part that made me human never made it out. Now, when I see images of what’s still happening, or hear about others’ struggles, I can’t bring myself to feel anything. I walk past people begging for help, and I feel no urge to stop.

I’m broken in ways no one can see. On the outside, I’m functioning. I smile, I work, I talk to people. But inside, I’m just as destroyed as the streets I left behind.

I think that “13 reasons why” is a very bad way of “spreading awareness”,"As the title suggests, I think that 13RW is a very bad portrayal of mental health, suicide, depression etc. and it shouldn’t be promoted as a show that “raises awareness”, when it’s just harmful. It portrays suicide as something “beautiful” and “meaningful” and not what it really is. And the whole “blame it on other people even though they tried to help me” thing? Nope nope nope, that’s so toxic. Idk if I just feel that way because of my PTSD (an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because I didn’t “help him enough” even though I did everything I could and was only 13), but it’s just not really how suicide should be portrayed, in my opinion. Also, the way they show flashbacks of Hannah Baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she’s still alive in some way. They reeeeally push this harmful “suicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people” agenda, when in reality, suicide is often the exact opposite. 
Idk, personally I really don’t like that show, and i think it’s harmful. I once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend, and she was all like “who made you feel that way?” like it was other people’s fault. Like sure, trauma and toxic relationships with people can worsen suicidal thoughts and depression but I just don’t feel like the show portrayed it in a helpful way.",mentalhealth,,Idk,35.1623028,129.1630181

CW: Suicide. I almost took my life. Twice. Therapy saved me. But my therapist didn’t. Here’s what I mean.,"TL;DR please seek help if you are struggling, if you’re unhappy, or even if you’re happy and want to stay that way. There is a light. 

3 years ago, my family home was foreclosed on. 2 years ago my mom had a stroke and was paralyzed and left unable to speak. 3 months ago she passed away after a long battle. I haven’t been able to speak to my best friend for 2 years and now I’ll never be able to. 

Within that time, I had two suicide attempts. I was on pills. I was drinking alone everyday. I was hospitalized. I was uninsured. I was homeless. I thought I was beyond repair. 

For two years now since then, I’ve been in therapy. Every week for two years. 

Now, I’m engaged. An awesome step son. I have a good job. A nice place to live. I’m excited for the future. 

Therapy saved me. But not my therapist. 

My therapist is amazing. He’s smart. Insightful. Knows when to listen. But when I started therapy, I thought my therapist would just tell me what to do. I’d do it. And I’d be fixed. 

That’s not how it worked for me. 

A lot of my friends who aren’t in therapy have been afraid to, or too stubborn to go seek help. 

They think they know better than a professional. BUT HERES THE RUB: My therapist didn’t know how to fix me. 

I did. 

(For me personally) therapy has been about bringing out repressed thoughts and feelings. Things I couldn’t talk to my friends about. Couldn’t talk about with my family.

Therapy also made me take accountability. For all my mistakes, the people I’ve wronged.

I can now accept my past and look to the future. A future I wanted to take away from myself. 

I hope if even one person reads this and feels inclined to help themselves. Because you can.

At that point, I gave up calling those hotlines. These people are not trained mental health professionals so they don't really know what to say.

There should be a psychiatrist instead of a school councillors to talk to students about their mental health.,"I am a teen and the school councillor I talked about my mental health with basically just told me that my grades are good so I don’t need to worry about it and that there many other students like me even in my own class. turns out I did need to worry about it because I had depression and by ignoring it only got worse. And also HOW IS KNOWING THAT OTHER PEOPLE FEEL LIKE SHIT TO SUPPOSED TO HELP THAT JUST UPSET ME EVEN MORE.

"I Am Thoroughly Disgusted By The Portrayal of Mental Health in 13 Reasons Why Season 4, And Disturbed By the Amount of People Defending It.","13 Reasons Why has always been controversial from the start. I understand where people come from when they say the first season glorified suicide. Personally, I believe the first season had good intentions, and truly was trying to raise awareness for suicide.

Of course, they completely sabotaged Hannah Baker’s character in S2, which had a detrimental effect on the message.

But Season 4 - oh, it makes my blood boil. Clay’s undiagnosed, undefined “mental illness” - at best described by the show as “trauma” - is used as an excuse for outrageously bad behavior. By bad behavior, I mean locking his friends in a cabin in the woods and clanging an axe against the door. I mean vandalizing his school and burning his principal’s car. I mean waving a gun around in front of the entire student body.

And worst of all, when he finds out his adoptive brother is dying, his immediate response is to run to the police station and yell, “I’ve got a gun!” Why? Because he needed people “to see how broken he was.”

This one really hit me close to home. When I was 6, my infant sister had to spend all 4.5 months of her life on a ventilator in the hospital. When she died - near Christmas time - I did not go terrorize people so that they could see “how broken I was.”

Yet [few people](https://youtu.be/ynewf90xWZc) see it that way. When I say this, 13 RW fans tell me “Well, you were 6. Your emotions were not as deep as our beloved FICTIONAL character Clay.”

I hate what that show became, and the perverse effect it has.

EDIT

Thank you for all of the heartfelt responses and experiences you have shared. I truly had started to believe I was in the minority with my critique of 13 Reasons Why. I’m glad to know there are others who share the same concerns.",mentalhealth,,S2,52.15680416296775,21.122011636297326
I don't want quarantine to end,"After a long time of chaos, this is the first time in many years I've been able to create a daily and healthy routine without getting overwhelmed by it and destroying it due to anxiety and changes. I have school phobia and I don't want Zoom classes to end, I feel so comfortable studying on a screen and not having to trigger my school and social phobia. Obviously there are things social distancing made it worse for me, like intrusive thoughts and lack of therapy but I'm now getting used to it and I fear when all of this ends I'm going to go to my unhealthy lifestyle again because of stress.",mentalhealth,,phobia,48.8351638,2.3609876
I failed my 2nd year of uni and I just need someone to tell me it's okay,"I'm doing so bad after getting better for the past year. 

Jesus fuck I'm trying so hard but I feel like no matter what I'll keep failing. I am genuinely interested in what I'm studying, but I'm so behind and have such bad work ethic now, I don't understand even the basics. I feel like an absolute idiot. 

I had this grand plan when I left highschool. I wanted to study outside of the US. It was really difficult to find a way to do it, but I had a dream and I was so determined to accomplish it. But depression hit me bad and I almost didn't graduate highschool, my parents didn't support me and I wasn't able to go to college because of it so I was forced to take a gap year. I broke my foot and was bed ridden for 6 months and became very depressed. Finally got to uni and failed the first year. Just failed my 2nd. I'm basically at 0 credits and 3 years behind where I'm supposed to be. My twin brother is almost graduating and I'm basically exactly where I was when I left highschool. I feel like I'm losing years off my life and for some reason I can't just live it.

Not to mention there's a lot of shitty things going on on top of all this and I just feel so fucking alone. I feel a loss of motivation to do anything. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel alone and unsupported, and so so afraid. I have no idea what my future holds, and I no longer have a dream. I just want to be happy again.",mentalhealth,,US,39.7837304,-100.445882

I’m all for expressing emotions in a healthy manner and using music as an emotional outlet, and certainly want to hear music that is honest... but not at the cost of minimizing the pain and struggles that people all over the world face on a daily basis. 

Being broken is not beautiful, being broken is sobbing uncontrollably when you have a delay getting your meds refilled while your boyfriend strokes your hair trying to convince you that things will get better. 

Addiction is not the modern day version of Romeo and Juliet, addiction is an stable & irreversible at best or a death sentence at worst. 

Staying in an abusive relationship is not “being loyal to your man/woman” and you’re not better than anyone else for “fighting through the bullshit” - you’re suffering from Stockholm Syndrome and I hope to God you get out soon.

It’s been 10 years since my suicide attempt and I’m so glad I didn’t succeed!!,"Somehow I missed my 10 year anniversary of the worst day of my life. I suppose that’s a good thing that I’m so involved with the good bits of life now that I almost forgot that this wasn’t always the case. 

Ten years ago I threw my legs out a 6th floor window at college, intending to hit the earth below me. I was in the thick of some really terrible times then. I was 19, heartbroken, homesick, lost, and very confused. I remember the sharp air that rushed in the room when I opened the window that very cold and snowy February night. It felt like little needles on my skin; a stark contrast to the hot, salty tears streaming down my face. I was in trouble for drinking on campus...again.  However, the drinking wasn’t just purely fun and games. I was using it to cope with a lot of uncertainty and hopelessness. My on again off again boyfriend told me he was dating someone else. He lived with my best guy friend at the time so a lot of “sides” were taken in the whole mess. And somewhere along the way my roommate moved out. I was alone. 

I spent the remainder of the week at the hospital under psychiatric care. The days I spent there blur together now. I was in such a haze of numbness. 
My entire life was uprooted. I got kicked out of college and I had to start over somewhere new. The next several years were spent kicking my ass into gear to show myself and the friends who abandoned me that they didn’t get the best of me. I pushed and pushed myself. I started looking forward and not backward. I learned to love myself again. Slowly. Very slowly. 

I graduated from a new (and better) college with honors two years later. I took a chance and bought a one way ticket to NYC and began living the life I used to only be able to dream about.

10 years later, I am living proof that things get better. Depression and anxiety are challenges I still deal with occasionally, but now I know how to handle it. 

Right now I’m sitting in the house I just bought all by myself. I’m reminiscing about the years I spent living and working in Manhattan, where I had an incredible job and amazing friends. Most days, my life felt like a happy movie. I recently decided to re-locate, slow things down and enjoy the present. Now I’m in the process of renovating my house from the inside out. I volunteer with an organization that raises funds for underprivileged women and children. I carve out time for my hobbies, friends, and loved ones. I’ve truly become a better person. I can now enjoy a glass or two of wine without overdoing it just to cope. I can take a deep breath, a small sip, and appreciate how far I’ve come.

I still have a long way to go. I’m still a work in progress. I haven’t found love yet but I look forward to the day I do. In the meantime, you can catch me cultivating my new herb garden and reading a good book or two. 

If you’re going through what I went through 10 years ago, my best advice is to hang on, know it does get better (and no this isn’t something that people just say. It’s true). You’re not alone. You’re loved. And you’re stronger than you think.
Take a deep breath, be thankful that you are able to do so, and repeat until you truly believe better days are around the corner.

TLDR - I’m 10 years post-suicide attempt and better than ever. I wanted to share my accomplishment with you all and hope this story might help someone.",mentalhealth,,Manhattan,40.7896239,-73.9598939
"If you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, this the wisdom I’ve gathered since my suicide attempt a decade ago.","First and foremost you need some rest. I would say that 10/10 times when I have suicidal ideation it’s also when I am over tired or over worked.

Secondly there are people in your life that genuinely care enough to force you into help. I know it’s scary to reach out to them and admit that you are having a hard time alone but I whole heartedly recommend it. I would not be alive to type this if it weren’t for the wonderful people in my support network. One method my friend and I came up with is that I can kill myself, I just have to get his permission first. This gives me the benefit of having the “option” but also puts the social pressure on me to never do it. 

I know you might think no one gives a shit, but the same people who would be devastated if you died would probably prefer to help you out before it gets to that point. There is something socially validating about suicide in the brain of the suicidal. It feels easier than to admit you are having a hard time. You feel like people will take what you are going through seriously. But plain and simple you will not be around to enjoy that validation because you will be dead. And all the people who would have helped you will be asking what they could have done. Instead of leaving the people you love on this Earth with the trauma of dealing with your death, please reach out to them.

Lastly what you have gone through is not easy. You may feel exhausted, defeated or even angry at others. Self reflection might be productive but you are right to feel angry at how they treated you. What you do with that anger is your responsibility now and it seems like you are just letting it eat away at you. Maybe there is some way to can transfer that anger into productivity or artistic expression. Who knows?

You have real problems. They suck, you’re totally right to feel that way. You should feel no blame that shitty things happen to you. But these problems are still your responsibility. And there are people out there who can help. Again I would not be alive today if it wasn’t for the friend I mentioned above and a wonderful therapist who came in at the right time. You may not have luck the first few times; my first therapist sent me into a mental breakdown. But I promise you that you will find the right fit if you keep trying.

Focus on the problems that you can solve. I think about the serenity prayer they say in AA every day. “Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference”. There are many issues in your life you may not have control over, but there are some that you do. Focus on those. Try to define them as precisely as possible. Don’t say “everybody hates me”. Say “everybody hates me when I ______”. The first is a cry of defeat. The second gives you a concrete area of yourself that you can improve. I always tell my friend “if you are going to hate yourself, at least be more specific”.

There is so much in life worth living for. A beautiful sunrise, your daughter’s graduation some day. Hell even if it’s just a new season of a tv show you love. The future is a mystery, and that’s a good thing. It means that everything is going to change. If things are good they are going to get worse. But that also means if things are bad they are going to get better. Take solace in that during the bad times and prepare yourself what things feel like they are going too well.

Don’t hesitate to dm me if there is anything I can help you with. We’re all on this crazy ride together.

God bless.

Thank you to everyone who shared their stories or sent their kind words. 

I hope that this post does not glamorize suicide attempts in any way. Yes I tried, but that doesn’t delegitimize the suffering of someone who hasn’t. Just because you haven’t attempted doesn’t make your situation any less valid or serious compared to anyone else’s. Remember my words above: a suicidal persons warped sense of reality tells them that suicide is a better option than reaching out for help. It is not. Ever.

Many of you have reached out to me in a PM and I thank you for reaching out to someone. I am always a friend in need to someone but I am not a professional. There are REAL professionals out there making a difference just waiting to be the change you need in your life. Remember the best thing you can do is reach out.

New job! Still homeless but I got a new job! Mental health is on the uptick!,"I am so fucking excited.   


Story time.   


Before Covid hit I was a leasing agent for a large Canadian REIT.  I was important, I was valued, I was paid very well. I had everything I wanted. I was fortunate enough to be sent to Calgary to launch one of the largest private student housing projects in Canadian history. Was a big big deal in the industry. Then Covid came along and decimated the Student housing industry. 50% of our clients were international and of the remaining 50% being domestic, only a small fraction of those were 'locally domestic' You can imagine what losing 90% of your paying clients can do for a project.  


I lost my job and came home defeated. My mental health suffered. My physical health suffered. My relationship suffered. I wasn't working, I wasn't a partner anymore. My girl left me in Dec.   


Things were hard. I was alone, I'm very much an introvert. The only people I talk to are people via Reddit or random women on dating apps. There's nobody I could call to come over and hang out with. Nobody I could call if I was having a dark moment. And there were many dark moments let me tell you.   


Winter blues is a thing. I'm a huge believer in that. I was living in a basement apartment that my ex and I shared before she left. I was so immobile emotionally and physically that for 5 months after she left I couldn't bring myself to removing anything she left behind. She took the cats, but the cat food sat in its dish for months. Her clothes still hung in the closet the way she left them. Every day was a dark dank lonely sad existence. I knew I needed a change. I had to change my outlook, my direction, my goals.   


I started talking to people on dating apps. I had no intention of seeing anyone. I just needed to talk to people again. That helped. I also started being more active on Reddit, that helped too. I like talking with people, I like giving advice. Small uptick in mental health after this.   
Then the sun started coming out. The grey dirty snow started going away. It was the end of April. Forced myself to go outside, even for a minute. Even for that very short walk to get milk. Instead of ordering it I went and got it. Small uptick in mental health after this.   
I got closure with my ex. Finally. Small uptick here.   


I needed something drastic though.   


So, voluntary homelessness. I left my apartment. I rented a room, and when that went to shit I started living out of my car. Waking up in the bush, next to a river, down by the ocean did wonders. Not caring or worrying about anything. Nothing at all, just being entirely selfish in my needs, my mental health. Huge uptick. I started smiling again. I started feeling better about everything. 

&#x200B;

Was going to spend the entire summer living outta my car. Then one random night I applied for a building manager job. Its become so much more than that.   


I was just given a job offer for a leasing agent role AND a building manager role. For a smaller REIT, but this position will require me to be very mobile. I could be driving 3hrs away to one of our buildings. I will never sit in an office. The company car is my office.   


Its going to be a couple weeks before I can afford an apartment, or I might just continue to live out of my car. Which may be tough because I'll also have a company car. So we'll see what happens there.   


But huge huge uptick. Motivation is high. Excitement is high. Self worth is high. I'm valued again. They were hugely impressed with my skill set, and its feels so damn good to be valued again.   


I wanted to share this because I've said to 100s of people on this very same sub that things can change, but you need to be the catalyst for that change. Nobody is going to come along and place change at your feet. You are responsible for everything that happens in your life, regardless of what has happened in your life. Wake up tomorrow, forge forward, make a small change in your life and allow it to snowball.   


Things are on an uptick now, but things dont get any easier. With this uptick comes a tremendous amount of responsibility. People are invested in me. This motivates me. I'll wake up tomorrow for my first day with a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm but will have to know and understand that a downtick can come at anytime. I'll deal with those when they come, I'm not going to worry about something that hasn't happened yet.   


Forward progress. Be the catalyst for change and personal growth. Have your pity party. Be sad. Have regret. But you gotta get over it, you gotta find closure and move on because the world will continue to spin without you. May aswell spin with it amirite?",mentalhealth,,Calgary,51.0456064,-114.057541

I called a suicide hotline recently and was dismissed because I’m a man and I have Tourette’s. 💦🦄😖,"I looked the # up on Google cause I was feeling unstable with signs of psychosis. I know these symptoms well enough after years of dealing with my illness.  I forced myself to remain calm so I could clearly communicate my situation. The woman (her name was Rachel)  speaking with was clearly overwhelmed by how many calls they’ve been getting.  When I told her I was having a mental health crisis she took me seriously enough, but then my verbal tics started.  I could tell that my tics were scaring her so I told her “I’m safe, I just have Tourettes”.  Then I heard the dreaded word come out of my mouth....cunt.  It was clearly a tic, but Rachel’s reaction was to tell me I couldn’t talk to her that way. Her tone went from scared shitless to anger. That was when I knew that there is not going to be any help for me. At least not from a woman.  I realized then that I wasn’t going to be able to get reliable help and to just get off the phone. To be honest, it kinda ramped up my paranoia also. 

Before I got off the phone I calmed myself and quietly told her, “YOU are a mental health professional who has trained for this. When a person experiencing a mental health crisis calls you and uses a word YOU find offensive you need to remember that YOU’RE feelings at that moment are minuscule compared to the pain the person on the other end is going through. Please think about this because you’re hurting some people more than you’re helping them”. 


I am so angry about this. I did everything right. I know from experience how broken our mental health system is, but this really hits a new low.  I took extensive notes because it seemed important and am really tempted to get that woman fired from her job for being so unprofessional, but frankly I’m worried I’ll get a woman on the line in HR and will again be dismissed because of sexism. From now on I will ask for and only speak with men when calling the Suicide Hotline(s).   

One thing I know for sure, I am not calling 911 for a trip to the psych ward anytime soon. If the mental health system is in this much crisis just over the phone imagine how bad it’s falling apart face to face. 

Thank god I’m already so used to self-isolating.

EDIT - 

Thank you to everyone who reached out, I appreciate it. 

Just so this doesn’t head into finger-pointing territory I want to clarify a few things.  It’s easy to take from this that I’m taking my anger out on women. That’s fair and TBH I’ll acknowledge a lack of trust on my part.

She exposed my entire breasts in the triage- not a room- there was no curtain even. She conducted the EKG all the while upset about the probes not sticking. I apologized many times but she didn't acknowledge me. She asked if I had anxiety and I said I have PTSD as I am a military veteran.

Last month I attempted suicide for the 4th time. Today I was promoted a week into my new job. It does get better.,"I have struggled with mental illness my entire life. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as a child, depression at 14, ADHD at 16, and bipolar disorder at 20. The first time I seriously considered suicide was when I was 10. Needless to say, it’s been rough.

The pandemic hit me especially hard. In June I quit my job of 6 years due to the effect it was having on my mental health. I was supposed to work at a summer camp in July anyways, but the governor decided the day before I was supposed to start that residential camps would not be running this year. Due to me quitting my previous job I wasn’t eligible for unemployment, so I was no longer able to afford a therapist or my medication.

I found a new job in July but my mental health had declined to the point where I was completely unable to do it. It also involved driving to a different facility every day, which would cause me to vomit with anxiety before every shift. After having a panic attack over parking in Boston, I ghosted them and decided that this was the end for me. I couldn’t do something as simple as sit and stare at a pool for 8 hours, even if the alternative was an empty bank account and a rising self-hatred. How would I ever be able to function independently?

That night I attempted to hang myself. Obviously, it didn’t work, and I’m still here. This frustrated me; I felt like such a failure that I couldn’t even succeed in dying. I ended up relapsing with self harm, and I spent the weeks after that consuming any substance I could get my hands on to numb the pain, waiting for the courage to try again.

After the very much warranted disappointment from my parents, I ended up applying for an overnight warehouse job for an online retailer. From the rumors I’d heard I expected it to suck, but they were right, I needed a job.

They hired me, and I started last week. Turns out it doesn’t suck. And I don’t suck at the job either. Within three days they asked me to apply for a promotion, and today I got a fancy new vest, my shift differential was bumped up by $1.50, and I finally have some hope for the future. I also found out if I stay for a year they can help pay for my education, so for the first time in forever I have a long-term plan for my future. Best of all, I can afford to get help again.

I know I’m going to feel shitty again, but it’s going to get better again after that. I have trouble remembering times like these when I’m really going through it, but for the first time in years I feel capable. I feel like I can take it. I’m a hard worker and I’m no quitter, why would I give up on life like that?

I guess my point is that no matter how dark it seems, how hopeless it feels, or how incompetent you think you are, there’s always a chance for it to get better. I’m moreso making this post to look back on the next time I’m suicidal, but I’m hoping my message will help others a little.

Please listen to what she had to say about mental illness: 'I also don't accept it that one should feel ashamed because he/she is suffering from a mental illness…everyone could be affected, no matter if he/she has a cheerful personality or not…I'm aware that \[I have\] a chronic disease and it belongs to your life but fortunately you can live with it.'

She was a warrior. She exuded warmth and light. She saved my life.

I have suffered from OCD, anxiety, and depression for 9 years. It has taken so much from me, but this loss was particularly cruel.

I believe I am speaking through Annika when I ask you to please stay. Please fight for your life. You matter. I love you. It does get better. I have been on medical leave of absence many times, I have seen more than a dozen providers, and I have given up on my biggest dream. I am also first-generation, and I have experienced the stigma surrounding mental illness in my community firsthand. But in this particular moment, I feel peace and love. I could not have imagined that on my darkest day. Your fight is valid and you are strong; please reject anything that suggests otherwise. Please take strength from Annika's words and my journey. Please carry on with the hope that she instilled in me. This life can still be beautiful for you.

And now, I ask that you please help me honor this beautiful soul.

Annika said, 'I admired and adored \[Avril Lavigne\] so much when I was a teenager, her music literally saved me back then.' She had a ticket for Avril’s concert in Germany—it would have been her second time—but it was cancelled due to COVID.

If you do not have Twitter, please post an Instagram story with a screenshot of the tweet and tag the same accounts.

And if you have any other suggestions or connections, let’s use them too!

Please help me do one last special thing for Annika. Your support means everything to me.

Annika deserved every drop of magic in this world. And you do too :) Please let her witness this from wherever she is watching us.

Thank you with all my heart. Keep fighting, my warriors! Annika and I believe in you!”",mentalhealth,,Germany,51.1638175,10.4478313
Social media is horrible for mental health but it's the only way anybody talks to me,"This post is brought on by something someone shared about how you act during a mental health episode towards others and their right to be done with you for it. As if we aren't suffering enough we have to worry even more than we do about the people we care about getting ""sick"" of us. I'm a 23 year old male who is basically a failure in the sense that beyond getting my GED hasn't really accomplished anything afterwards due to mental health spiraling. I can't work and can't seem to get approved for ssi or ssdi. It's gotten to a point where I'm about to be homeless cause family has given up on me. I have 1 friend and everyone else has left because they can't deal with me venting when I'm dealing with alot. Diagnosed with depression anxiety bipolar bpd and cptsd. It seems nobody around me tolerates the mentally ill unless they work 40+ hours a week go to college etc. I've had people call me a mooch and that I'm a failure to society many times. Honestly I'm at the lowest I've ever been and it seems I won't survive. I have no support structure and am not in therapy anymore cause my last therapist gave up on me.

I got sexually assaulted 2 hours ago and my parents blame me for it [F19],"On a 1-hour ride in a crowded bus an older man kept touching my breast and offering me money after I repeatedly refused and raised my voice and tried to protect myself. The bus was so crowded I couldn't get away from him. Everyone noticed and did NOTHING said NOTHING. Other older man started watching and seemed entertained. I live in a third world country. After the man got off the bus some people started talking that it was very disturbing what he did  but NO ONE did NOTHING to stop it.

I got home crying and told my parents what happened. They blame me and tell me that it's because of the way I dressed. That I deserved it for not dressing appropriately. That it was my fault. I was dressed In a short large dress with no cleavege (I'm petite) and it's not even a dress, the skirt part is actually shorts.

I was trying to explain how miserable I am but they kept interrupting me, shouting ""you should have done that, that"". I told them about another situations that happened 4 years ago where I was also sexually assaulted in public. But that time I was dressed with a lot of clothes. They told me my fault that time was that I didn't scream or say anything. So again it's my fault. 

!!!!! They said that it's my fault that he thought I was a hooker (this hurts SO much my heart aches)

It's my fault for what happened today implying that I deserve it.

There are no words to describe how I am feeling right now. I am a very sensitive person in general and a lot of things affect me deeply.

I am crying my heart out right now in the corner of a dark room praying for someone in this world who would come right now to give me a hug and actually listen to me and understand me. I want to overcome this (I have 1 week until uni starts, idk how I'm gonna do that) but at the same time I cannot believe these are MY parents and this is what they told me and think of me. 

I am so traumatized and crying incontrollably right now that I feel like I'm gonna explode. I feel betrayed and unprotected. 

*The point for this post is that I DO NOT want to go mentally insane from everything that happened. I do not want to wake up one day in the mental hospital. My mental state is very shaky right now. Please help me , I don't know how but please help me. I don't want to lose my health*

I keep thinking “I’d rather die than deal with anything stressful” but I don’t want to actually die.,"I always feel like anything I say or think is “being dramatic” like in dealing with Jeckyl and Hyde in my head.  I worry and stress about things that have happened, will happen, might happen, might not happen, or surely won’t happen.  My day is consumed with these thoughts to the point where I get a migraine, cry it out, hold it in, get mad.... I’ve been on anxiety medication... all of them, off and on for years.  At the point now where I’m too anxious to take anxiety medication because I’m anxious to get side effects.  Backwards I know...  I’ve seen a therapist before but not for awhile.  I always felt like I was bothering them.

But I feel strange for being like this because I am 33, I’m married, have three kids, a house, a job, a nice large family, lots of friends and cousins and a dog etc and there’s no issues... but most days I end my day thinking “I feel like if I just were to die, I wouldn’t have to deal with these feelings anymore, and I’d be free.” And that’s in regards to my irrational worry and negative thoughts that I alone put in my head.  But I don’t want to die.  I’m afraid of dying actually.  

I’ve been fine my entire life except for when I had my second son 11 years ago.  He was born with club foot.  I spent all my maternity leave going to Children’s hospital for castings, surgery, etc. He had an MRI last year and got orthopedics.  He’s fine and happy and healthy.  But since he was born I changed and I’ve developed panic attacks, anxiety, depression, IBS that put me in the ER 4 times, ulcers.  I worry that bad things will happen to me or my kids non stop.  I can’t stop the play button.  

So yes this is kind of venting but I’m at a loss and I try not to talk about this with anything because I feel like I’m being too whiny and dramatic.  Everyone’s response is always your son is fine now, basically get over it.  But I’ve always felt like I had some sort of PTSD (I don’t know if that’s actually what it would be) after my sons situation because I’ve never gotten over what he went through and what I went through mentally and financially because of it.

Any advice on where I should go from here or what I should do... would be appreciated.",mentalhealth,,Jeckyl,40.6058333,-73.6527778
I called a helpline for the first time tonight,"I called the Samaritans (UK) on 116 123 for the first time tonight. 

I spoke to a wonderful volunteer called James. I said I didn't really know how it works and he just said ""It's simple, you talk and I listen"" he reassured me that they can't give advice. They won't tell you not to cut and they won't call the police unless they seriously need to, they also can't see your number. They can simply listen and offer an ear. I spoke calmly about my struggles and my life and he listened for like half an hour. I honestly nearly cried he was so reassuring and spent so long with me even though I wasn't in desperate need. I came away feeling a lot better and promised to call next time i feel like cutting.

I've never called a helpline before as I thought it would be very scripted but he just got me talking about family, my partner, my house and other things. Really got my mind out of a bad place so honestly just give it a go. The worst that can happen is you feel no better

I'm gonna vent about this because I know I'm not the only one. This is something that I just recently realized and it takes a lot of weight off my shoulders to finally know why I am the way I am. This was really an eye opener for me. This is my story. *TW*

The worst part about child abuse is for a lot of us, we are too young to understand that we're even being abused. Especially in terms of emotional abuse. We don't know any different. We grew up being treated like this, and we know something doesn't feel right, but we decide it must be a problem with us. ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" 
Thankfully I did know that the physical abuse I was receiving was not okay, but honestly it took me 24 years to fully realize that I was emotionally abused as a child. 24 YEARS.

I was emotionally and physically abused by my parents and other family members (mostly my mother) starting as a very very young child, possibly infant. Of course as a child you are incapable of understanding that you are not to blame. Because of this, I believed that I was broken, horrible, and stupid. I thought something was wrong with me. Why else would my parents not love me? In my own eyes I had to be at fault. Something was wrong with me. Even as a preschooler and kindergartener I have memories of thinking ""why do I have to be me?"" and ""what's wrong with me?"". My self esteem was non-existent. 

I remember going to my pediatric doctor due to a skin infection I had as a kindergartener. I had to see this doctor weekly, and because she was so kind to me (as a doctor should be, or any adult honestly) I started to see her as a parent figure. She made me feel loved and safe when my own mother did not. I remember I brought her a picture of me that we got from school picture day. She told my parents that I must have asperger's because of how socially awkward I was and how I acting around her (the doctor.) This later proved to be false, but again added to my feeling that I was broken and bad. We stopped seeing that doctor and my parents were furious at me. Why was it not clear to this doctor that I was insecurely attached?

My self esteem and hatred towards myself only got worse as time went on, and by 4th grade I was having full on almost passing out panic attacks. Started as hypochondria, but quickly became social anxiety. I could NOT function in school because I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin. Nobody wanted to be my friend. Nobody cared about me. The teachers HATED me. And then at home, nobody loved me. When people would look at me I wanted to just disappear. I made myself believe that I was incapable of making friends or being likable which in turn basically made me be unlikable. Ironic. Nobody wanted to be around me because my anxiety made me very awkward. I viewed myself as lesser than everyone else which would follow me into adulthood. Eventually I could not talk in front of the class. If I even knew I had to say a single word in front of the class or have everyone look at me I would literally run out of the room. Complete full on flight mode. Instead of being diagnosed with ANXIETY, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I couldn't focus because I was probably always disassociating. School was not the most important thing in my mind because at both at home and at school I was trying to survive. Why on earth would school be the first thing on my mind? 

Of course I fell behind in school and struggled to keep up with assignments which in turn made me feel even more stupid. When they had psychologists coming in to my classroom to study me, it only worsened my hatred towards myself. ""They're only watching me and studying me because there's something wrong with me."" I started seeing the school psychologist, therapist and social worker weekly. I was put into remedial classes and on an IEP. I was placed in some classes with children with severe behavioral and intellectual disabilities. I was forced to take IQ tests. In 6th grade I was literally forced to STACK BLOCKS while a psychologist watched. I'll never forget seeing the notes the psychologist wrote after that. ""Lots of nervous laughter."" No shit. I'm 12 and you're having me stack 5 blocks in a specific pattern. This is after they found out I had an average IQ, mind you. Everything that they did, whether they were trying to help or not, made me feel worse about myself. ""Why can't I be like the regular kids?"" is all that went through my brain. Every single thing that happened to me only solidified the belief in my head that something was wrong with me.

I was embarrassed of my own existence.

When I'd go home and try to explain that I would shake and be so scared that I couldn't even think straight in school my parents would just scream at me. I remember getting punched in the stomach and told to suck it up after just trying to explain what was going on. I had no one to turn to. 

By 7th grade I could not go to school. If I knew I'd have to work with other students or even be looked at in front of the class I would skip school. And honestly, it wasn't that school itself was a problem. I liked school itself. I couldn't function with my low self esteem and hatred towards myself. I constantly felt singled out. I felt bad that other people even had to look at me. I was too young to put this into words, and all I was able to say to anyone about what was going on was that talking in front of the class makes me scared and shakey. 

After I started getting in trouble for missing so much school (after the school social worker and principal drove to my house to talk to my parents and do a wellness check on my family), I went with extreme measures. Even running away from home and hiding which ended up with the police looking for me. All because I didn't want to have to panic. I tried to explain my anxiety in the best way a child can without even understanding what anxiety is. I was treated like a delinquent child instead.
Ended up in court after missing hundreds of days of school and had to do weeks of community service. AT 12 YEARS OLD.

I was showing so many signs of an abused child and I had definitely brought up my family physical abuse multiple times to adults at school and nobody heard me. Nobody. I was not a delinquent. I was suffering so noticeably yet somehow nobody noticed. 

By high school I refused to wear my glasses so I wouldn't have to see people looking at me in the hallway. I was still in remedial classes all those years later, which were mostly for kids with behavioral issues.  Kids that would kick, fight, scream, do drugs, you name it - this was not me at all.  I think I gave up trying to speak out because I tried so many times and I couldn't get anyone to hear me. I ended up dropping out of high school.

Fast forward to three years ago when I was going to pursue my dream of studying and then hopefully teaching abroad in Japan. Saved up for three years for my student visa and relearned everything from the ground up to get my GED. Did both things, got accepted and started my Japanese school in Tokyo. Never in my life had I been so proud of myself. I didn't even believe I was capable of accomplishing anything in my life. The moment that plane landed I cried my first ever happy tears.

Two weeks into language school, we were going around the table of probably 20 other students learning verbs at a very fast pace. I remember time slowing down while I was waiting for it to be my turn, then I blacked out. When I came to I ran out of the classroom. I left school and walked around Tokyo sobbing. I had gotten that far and somehow completely forgot how bad my self esteem and anxiety are. My dreams completely clouded out the truth. I knew I couldn't continue with school so I dropped out, then impulsively blew all of my tuition money that I saved for years on bullshit. After coming home I hit rock bottom and was hospitalized. Once again, the belief that I was broken was renewed in my mind.

At the hospital I was told ""you're not severe enough for inpatient treatment"". The doctor spent a total of maybe 4 minutes with me. Asked me a couple questions, checked me for head injuries, and left. I went to the hospital because I knew that if I went back home I was going to end my life. I was so used to stuffing my emotions down into myself at this point in my life that even if I was on the edge of ending it all - I looked calm. I even explained to them this. After waiting 6 hours after seeing the doctor, they sent me to a place thats only purpose was to keep you from harming yourself. Great, but when I went back home I learned nothing. No coping skills, didn't talk to a single mental health professional, nothing. I was back at square one. I reached out for help for the first time as an adult and was again, failed.

Inside my head was still the once tiny little girl wondering, ""what is wrong with me?""

Memories of my childhood were again, flashing back. I sat in my room for months. I couldn't leave the house. I had no desire to exist. I ripped up every baby photo I had with my mother in them. I honestly thought I wouldn't live another year. I was going to end up killing myself. I lost all of my hope.

Now, a couple years after that I'm finally now just getting the real help I need. I had to be the one to keep reaching out. It was very hard, but I am so glad I did. I had to keep picking myself back up, again and again; If I hadn't I would not be alive. I'm so glad that I chose to fight for my life. I searched for a long time for a good psychiatrist and therapist. I finally found someone who heard me. I have even been able to forgive people who abused me. Of course I still and always will have scars, but now I am able to cope with them. 
I now know I am not broken. I am a survivor and I have been and was just trying to survive. People are now shocked when I tell them I have ""social anxiety."" Eventually I will go back to Japan when I am actually ready. 

Learning about CPTSD and realizing WHY I am the way I am has been extremely important to me. Just like I'm finally connecting the dots. I'm finally starting to love myself. The little girl that once felt so unloved is finally healing. 

I encourage all of you to learn how your trauma affects you, and know that you can also heal from it. 💕 I hope someone out there will read this and feel like there is hope. I truly hope this inspired someone out there that is in an awful place like I once was. Do not give up on yourself.

Please remember: You're not broken. You're surviving.

The cycle of abuse ends with us!",mentalhealth,,Japan,36.5748441,139.2394179

I remember going to my pediatric doctor due to a skin infection I had as a kindergartener. I had to see this doctor weekly, and because she was so kind to me (as a doctor should be, or any adult honestly) I started to see her as a parent figure. She made me feel loved and safe when my own mother did not. I remember I brought her a picture of me that we got from school picture day. She told my parents that I must have asperger's because of how socially awkward I was and how I acting around her (the doctor.) This later proved to be false, but again added to my feeling that I was broken and bad. We stopped seeing that doctor and my parents were furious at me. Why was it not clear to this doctor that I was insecurely attached?

My self esteem and hatred towards myself only got worse as time went on, and by 4th grade I was having full on almost passing out panic attacks. Started as hypochondria, but quickly became social anxiety. I could NOT function in school because I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin. Nobody wanted to be my friend. Nobody cared about me. The teachers HATED me. And then at home, nobody loved me. When people would look at me I wanted to just disappear. I made myself believe that I was incapable of making friends or being likable which in turn basically made me be unlikable. Ironic. Nobody wanted to be around me because my anxiety made me very awkward. I viewed myself as lesser than everyone else which would follow me into adulthood. Eventually I could not talk in front of the class. If I even knew I had to say a single word in front of the class or have everyone look at me I would literally run out of the room. Complete full on flight mode. Instead of being diagnosed with ANXIETY, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I couldn't focus because I was probably always disassociating. School was not the most important thing in my mind because at both at home and at school I was trying to survive. Why on earth would school be the first thing on my mind? 

Of course I fell behind in school and struggled to keep up with assignments which in turn made me feel even more stupid. When they had psychologists coming in to my classroom to study me, it only worsened my hatred towards myself. ""They're only watching me and studying me because there's something wrong with me."" I started seeing the school psychologist, therapist and social worker weekly. I was put into remedial classes and on an IEP. I was placed in some classes with children with severe behavioral and intellectual disabilities. I was forced to take IQ tests. In 6th grade I was literally forced to STACK BLOCKS while a psychologist watched. I'll never forget seeing the notes the psychologist wrote after that. ""Lots of nervous laughter."" No shit. I'm 12 and you're having me stack 5 blocks in a specific pattern. This is after they found out I had an average IQ, mind you. Everything that they did, whether they were trying to help or not, made me feel worse about myself. ""Why can't I be like the regular kids?"" is all that went through my brain. Every single thing that happened to me only solidified the belief in my head that something was wrong with me.

I was embarrassed of my own existence.

When I'd go home and try to explain that I would shake and be so scared that I couldn't even think straight in school my parents would just scream at me. I remember getting punched in the stomach and told to suck it up after just trying to explain what was going on. I had no one to turn to. 

By 7th grade I could not go to school. If I knew I'd have to work with other students or even be looked at in front of the class I would skip school. And honestly, it wasn't that school itself was a problem. I liked school itself. I couldn't function with my low self esteem and hatred towards myself. I constantly felt singled out. I felt bad that other people even had to look at me. I was too young to put this into words, and all I was able to say to anyone about what was going on was that talking in front of the class makes me scared and shakey. 

After I started getting in trouble for missing so much school (after the school social worker and principal drove to my house to talk to my parents and do a wellness check on my family), I went with extreme measures. Even running away from home and hiding which ended up with the police looking for me. All because I didn't want to have to panic. I tried to explain my anxiety in the best way a child can without even understanding what anxiety is. I was treated like a delinquent child instead.
Ended up in court after missing hundreds of days of school and had to do weeks of community service. AT 12 YEARS OLD.

I was showing so many signs of an abused child and I had definitely brought up my family physical abuse multiple times to adults at school and nobody heard me. Nobody. I was not a delinquent. I was suffering so noticeably yet somehow nobody noticed. 

By high school I refused to wear my glasses so I wouldn't have to see people looking at me in the hallway. I was still in remedial classes all those years later, which were mostly for kids with behavioral issues.  Kids that would kick, fight, scream, do drugs, you name it - this was not me at all.  I think I gave up trying to speak out because I tried so many times and I couldn't get anyone to hear me. I ended up dropping out of high school.

Fast forward to three years ago when I was going to pursue my dream of studying and then hopefully teaching abroad in Japan. Saved up for three years for my student visa and relearned everything from the ground up to get my GED. Did both things, got accepted and started my Japanese school in Tokyo. Never in my life had I been so proud of myself. I didn't even believe I was capable of accomplishing anything in my life. The moment that plane landed I cried my first ever happy tears.

Two weeks into language school, we were going around the table of probably 20 other students learning verbs at a very fast pace. I remember time slowing down while I was waiting for it to be my turn, then I blacked out. When I came to I ran out of the classroom. I left school and walked around Tokyo sobbing. I had gotten that far and somehow completely forgot how bad my self esteem and anxiety are. My dreams completely clouded out the truth. I knew I couldn't continue with school so I dropped out, then impulsively blew all of my tuition money that I saved for years on bullshit. After coming home I hit rock bottom and was hospitalized. Once again, the belief that I was broken was renewed in my mind.

At the hospital I was told ""you're not severe enough for inpatient treatment"". The doctor spent a total of maybe 4 minutes with me. Asked me a couple questions, checked me for head injuries, and left. I went to the hospital because I knew that if I went back home I was going to end my life. I was so used to stuffing my emotions down into myself at this point in my life that even if I was on the edge of ending it all - I looked calm. I even explained to them this. After waiting 6 hours after seeing the doctor, they sent me to a place thats only purpose was to keep you from harming yourself. Great, but when I went back home I learned nothing. No coping skills, didn't talk to a single mental health professional, nothing. I was back at square one. I reached out for help for the first time as an adult and was again, failed.

Inside my head was still the once tiny little girl wondering, ""what is wrong with me?""

Memories of my childhood were again, flashing back. I sat in my room for months. I couldn't leave the house. I had no desire to exist. I ripped up every baby photo I had with my mother in them. I honestly thought I wouldn't live another year. I was going to end up killing myself. I lost all of my hope.

Now, a couple years after that I'm finally now just getting the real help I need. I had to be the one to keep reaching out. It was very hard, but I am so glad I did. I had to keep picking myself back up, again and again; If I hadn't I would not be alive. I'm so glad that I chose to fight for my life. I searched for a long time for a good psychiatrist and therapist. I finally found someone who heard me. I have even been able to forgive people who abused me. Of course I still and always will have scars, but now I am able to cope with them. 
I now know I am not broken. I am a survivor and I have been and was just trying to survive. People are now shocked when I tell them I have ""social anxiety."" Eventually I will go back to Japan when I am actually ready. 

Learning about CPTSD and realizing WHY I am the way I am has been extremely important to me. Just like I'm finally connecting the dots. I'm finally starting to love myself. The little girl that once felt so unloved is finally healing. 

I encourage all of you to learn how your trauma affects you, and know that you can also heal from it. 💕 I hope someone out there will read this and feel like there is hope. I truly hope this inspired someone out there that is in an awful place like I once was. Do not give up on yourself.

I'm gonna vent about this because I know I'm not the only one. This is something that I just recently realized and it takes a lot of weight off my shoulders to finally know why I am the way I am. This was really an eye opener for me. This is my story. *TW*

The worst part about child abuse is for a lot of us, we are too young to understand that we're even being abused. Especially in terms of emotional abuse. We don't know any different. We grew up being treated like this, and we know something doesn't feel right, but we decide it must be a problem with us. ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" 
Thankfully I did know that the physical abuse I was receiving was not okay, but honestly it took me 24 years to fully realize that I was emotionally abused as a child. 24 YEARS.

I was emotionally and physically abused by my parents and other family members (mostly my mother) starting as a very very young child, possibly infant. Of course as a child you are incapable of understanding that you are not to blame. Because of this, I believed that I was broken, horrible, and stupid. I thought something was wrong with me. Why else would my parents not love me? In my own eyes I had to be at fault. Something was wrong with me.

After coming clean to my parents about my intense suicidal idealization, the crisis calmed down a bit and I decided that I wanted to sleep in my own bed (I was tired and didn’t want to spend 5 hours in the ER waiting) and to go in the morning. I woke up this morning to my cat curled up next to me. He rarely sleeps with me. I think he knows that I wasn’t okay. He’s like my guardian cat, watching guard over me to make sure I’m okay and be my companion so I could look over at him, pet him, and feel a small twinge of love for something. Happiness isn’t the right word, I don’t think I’m capable of feeling happiness right now. But when I look at my cats, I feel like maybe there is something, even if it small, that’s worth living for. My cats would be sad if I wasn’t there. I think that our animals know when we aren’t okay.",mentalhealth,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668

But what if there was no before, no better, and I’m just a piece of shit pretending I’m depressed but I’m actually just a sack of garbage.  I’ve screwed up my life so much at this point.  Idk.

"I haven’t self harmed in over a month, I almost did today, but I stopped myself.","My last time I self harmed was the worst time I ever did it. It was kind of a wake up call.

It’s been over a month that i haven’t hurt myself purposely, and it’s been nice. Ive been taking new meds that definitely help

Today was the first day where I almost did though. It was scary and I really wanted to
It took everything in me not to.

I may not be perfect next time I want to, but I’m proud of myself today for not doing it.

EDIT: thank you all so much 💖
I genuinely wasn’t expecting so many kind comments and upvotes and awards. The only person who knows that I SH is my sister so I could only share it with her, so it’s nice that I got a whole of support on here. 
Talking about my SH is still strange for me since I didn’t even know that what I do is SH until a few months ago. So it’s been a harder habit to break since I didn’t know that I was doing it. 
So thank you all very much",mentalhealth,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
"If your compassion doesn't include yourself, it's incomplete - be as kind and understanding to yourself as you would be to a friend who is suffering","Compassion is something we find easy when we think of someone we love. But what about someone you find annoying or don’t like? If you think about someone you’ve met who wasn’t very nice to you, or someone that was rude or did something you didn’t agree with, you might ask the question why would you feel compassion for someone who behaves this way. 

The importance of compassion isn’t only to relieve suffering and make the world a better place, it’s to free yourself from your own suffering - your sadness, your anxiety and particularly your anger. When you see the suffering of others in their behaviour it helps to reduce your own resentments.

But where we can really struggle is feeling compassion towards ourselves; when we’re suffering we sometimes punish ourselves more for not being good enough. Compassion begins with yourself - when you let go of the idea of who you think you need to be and accept yourself as you are it’s an act of kindness that allows you to start to let go of suffering.

"Six months after my suicide attempt, I’m traveling alone and loving life.","Almost exactly six months ago, I tried to take my life. I was misdiagnosed with MDD but after my attempt and hospitalization was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was put on new medication, started therapy, moved to a new apartment and generally hit the reset button on my life.

Now, I’m traveling Europe alone for the first time. I’m doing what I want when I want, meeting new people, seeing things I never thought I’d see, and loving every minute of it. Every second I think about the fact that I could have not had this opportunity. I could have cut my life short and never been to Europe, never felt the freedom of standing at the top of a waterfall in Iceland or on the River Thames in London. 

I’m so thankful that I made the call before it was too late, and that I had people in my corner when I woke up in the emergency room that cold March morning. I’m glad that I chose life, despite how hard it can be, how cloudy and dark and hopeless it is at times. I’m glad that I sought help and got the help that I needed.

I still feel hopeless and lost and miserable sometimes. We all do. But I want every person here to take a deep breath before they consider ending their short, beautiful life too soon. You never know what more there is to see and feel and experience. I love myself now, and I love you all.

Cheers xx

Edit: Thank you all for your support! I wanted to clarify that I wasn’t meaning to brag or seem like I just dropped everything and hopped on a plane. I actually planned this trip back in January, before my attempt, which perhaps makes it even more profound. I was tempted to cancel the trip during my treatment and recovery, but after six months I’m finally trusting myself again and feeling connected to myself and the world around me. Getting on the plane felt terrifying, but I’m so glad I went through with something that is good for me mentally, emotionally and spiritually. It’s a chance to sit with my thoughts and take in the world around me. My Eurotrip can be your anything—going somewhere new or sitting in a park you pass everyday. I just want you to feel as alive as I do!

I don’t give a shit if someone is “faking” anxiety/depression.,"Disclaimer: this isn’t targeted at any one individual or group, but rather a school of thought that seems to have penetrated everyday discourse surrounding mental health. If I say “you” or “you people”, I’m referring to people who subscribe to the bullshit thinking I’m about to outline. This was meant to be posted to r/unpopularopinion but got deleted, so I figured y’all could appreciate my sentiment instead.

It seems like whenever I see a post about mental health (outside of subs that are directly related to the concept), the same point comes up.

*”DuH… like 90% of people who say they have depression are just faking it for attention! All those kids on TikTok just want to LARP as Billie Eilish and pretend they have a mental illness so they can be trendy!!”*

Just, stop. And I say this as someone with *diagnosed* depression, anxiety and ADHD. Here’s why this way of thinking is complete and utter **horse shit**.

First off, depression/anxiety are *incredibly* common, and exist on a wide spectrum of severity. When people see someone who claims they’re depressed, but still manages to go to work/school without many problems, they automatically jump to the thought of “oh well they seem to be doing pretty well. they’re not *really* depressed.”

This is such bullshit because unless you’ve advanced science by 5 decades and figured out how to read someone else’s thoughts, you don’t know what the fuck they’re going through. Even if that “normal” person seems functional, there’s no telling what’s going on in their head. 

You think everyone who has “real” depression is a lifeless sack of garbage who sits in bed crying all day? Guess what, there’s probably a handful of people at your job/in your class that have “real” depression. They just hide it well because that’s what people with mental health issues *have to do* in order to succeed.

Second, on the flip side of the coin, *so many* people assume the complete opposite. “This person has depression and ADHD, but doesn’t take care of themselves and can’t hold down a job without breaking down? God, another faker, huh? That’s not mental illness, that’s *laziness*”.

Like, *what the fuck is wrong with you???* That’s literally what severe mental illness does to you? If “depression” can’t exist if you’re doing well on the surface, and it *also* can’t exist if you’re doing terribly on the surface, then what the hell do you think depression is!?

But even putting aside the obvious lack of understanding regarding mental health, it’s *still* fucked up to call someone out as a “faker”.

Look at it this way, let’s say someone actually *is* faking it. They post on social media claiming they have depression, but they actually don’t.

*WHO FUCKING CARES?*

Even if they don’t have a diagnosed mental illness, they clearly aren’t getting the attention they need outside of social media. And since when is asking for attention a bad thing? Most of the people who receive these complaints are *literally children.* You think that if a fucking *child* is resorting to random strangers online for support, there’s absolutely *nothing* wrong with them? And they *don’t* need people to hear them out? Of fucking course not!!

And here’s the biggest problem. WHO ARE WE TO DECIDE WHETHER SOMEONE IS FAKING OR NOT?

Mental illness transcends class, race and gender. Nobody is immune from chronic depression/anxiety. 99% of the time you *cannot fucking tell* if someone has a mental illness or not. Because it’s a **M E N T A L** illness. 

So why take the chance on saying “oh they’re just lying for attention”, when there’s a strong possibility that they’re serious and you’re just making it worse by making them feel like an impostor?

Seriously, what does anyone stand to gain from calling someone out for “faking it”? 

“Oh, but the more people who fake it, the more stigma there will be against people who have *actual* mental illness.”

Bull. Shit. Where do you think that stigma is coming from? Because it sure as fuck isn’t coming from people who actually care about mental health.

It’s coming from people like you, who refuse to believe that mental illness can affect *everyone*. No mental health professional, or doctor, or caring person is shutting these people down. It’s just people like you. The resources to treat mental health are always available, but people who need them aren’t getting them because they’re constantly told that they’re making it worse for people who have “real” mental illness.

And one more thing.

“Oh you probably self-diagnosed, didn’t you? That means your mental illness isn’t real.”

Oh, fuuuuuuck off.

First of all, how do you think you get a diagnosis in the first place? You think a doctor is gonna come to your house, take one look at you and say “yep, you’ve got depression”. That’s not how it works! You get a diagnosis by recognizing symptoms within yourself, condensing them and narrowing it down to a few possibilities, then bringing that info to a professional when/if you can. This process is known as, you guessed it, **self-diagnosis**.

And what about people who *can’t* get diagnosed? I’m lucky enough to live in a place where mental health is taken seriously and covered by insurance. So, I was able to be diagnosed and treated from a young age.

What about people who aren’t so lucky? In the US, you can pay up to $500 for an initial consultation. Not everyone can afford that. And in some countries, mental health treatment is a fucking joke.  It’s chocked up to weakness or insanity sometimes, so good luck getting a diagnosis in one of those places. And actually getting a prescription for meds? That’s a whole other mountain to climb, even in more progressive countries.

So if you’re in an area where getting a diagnosis is next to impossible, what are you supposed to do? Just sit there feeling miserable and telling no one because you “might be faking it”? Fuck no, you get online and do what you can to find support and raise awareness for others in your situation.

Bottom line, nobody knows what mental illnesses someone else is or isn’t dealing with. And even if you do, why the hell do you care?

33 m. I had sex with my therapist after two years of being treated for Borderline Personality Disorder.,"So this is a long one. Going to try and keep it short, and be available to answer questions.

Two years ago, with nearly 20 years of mood swings, sadness, anger, substance abuse, and hyper sexual behaviors behind me, I decided it was time to get help. My wife of 8 years was asking for a divorce, and my life had become unmanageable.

I started seeing a psychologist through the VA. I’m an army veteran. She turned out to be a specialist in BPD and after some time was able to diagnose me. I had always suspected either BPD or Bipolar. 

We’ve worked together for about 2 years and have made amazing progress. She leads a Dialectic Behavioral Therapy group that worked wonders for me. It was life changing. Emotional intelligence, mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance are all part of my life now. I’m not perfect, and I’m always willing to put in the work, but life is better than ever before. I truly feel like my BPD is in recession. I also recently got sober, which helps a lot.

So this last February my wife and I separated. This is primarily due to my unstable moods, anger issues, substance abuse, and hyper sexuality. I moved into my own place and it took months to stabilize and get into a healthy and productive routine.

My last appointment with my therapist, I mentioned that I understood I was in a vulnerable situation and I was taking dating very cautiously. Being roughly 70 days sober, not completely over my ex, and prone to emotional dependency, I need to really consider my actions and emotions. I’m in a vulnerable place where I could relapse in a few different ways.

Well two days after that she texts me at 11:30 pm and starts flirting with me. She’s never texted me before and acknowledged how risky it was to do so.

She even mentioned the fact that I said I was vulnerable, and stated she felt vulnerable as well.

I at first told her I wasn’t available because I had gone on a date with a new girl and wanted to give that my full attention while I figured out where it was going. Also, I’m not attracted to this woman.

Another day goes by and I can’t fight the curiosity. I started texting her and just soaked up the attention what felt sexually deviant. Asking her about why she likes me. What she’s into. What she would do to me. What she wants me to do to her.

Here’s the thing. I have a history periods of being sexually involved with people who I’m not attracted to because I like the attention, I like being used, and I like things that feel taboo. I almost always end up feeling ashamed and disgusted by my behavior when this happens. And this woman, more than anyone knows all of that about me. 

Well two nights after she texted me for the first time, I went over to her place to give her what she wanted. She didn’t pressure me to, so we were both consenting, but it doesn’t feel good now. I almost immediately realized I wasn’t into what I was doing, but I stayed and kept doing things until I got her off. Then I left.

Looking back on it, it feels a little predatory. Here’s the person I’ve been most honest with about my hyper sexual episodes and how they’ve always made me feel bad. And I end up getting baited into just that. 

I’m not going to report her. At this point I should have better control over myself. But I’m disappointed in both of us.

I’ve since asked her to refer me to a new therapist. She did so happily and respectfully, and the new one feels like a great fit. 

There ya go.

EDIT:

I want to thank everyone for the overwhelming response to this post. I have to admit, I was honestly struggling with whether or not I should feel bad about this situation. It’s pretty clear now that what she did was wrong. Had the cards not been so stacked in her favor, she’s definitely not someone I would’ve been intimate with.

So here’s the update, and I’ll say at the beginning that many people are going to be less than satisfied. I reached out to her and told her exactly how I feel about what happened, how it was manipulative and I’m left feeling used. She seemed to be apologetic and understanding as to why I felt that way. I say “seemed” because to be brutally honest I don’t know if this is a one time fuck up, or a calculated cruel person just doing her thing. Of course when you get called out on doing something wrong, you say whatever it takes to deescalate the situation. So who the fuck knows. 

I want to preface this next part with my feelings of how to support people dealing with abuse, trauma, and the like. I think it’s important to make yourself available to listen, offer support, and support them in finding closure, however they deem necessary. I’ve had friends who were assaulted and didn’t report it, and I tried to understand that it’s their closure to find, not mine.

She said I’d be well within my rights to report this, if I decided to do so. I’m not planning on reporting her. I’m not blaming myself for what happened, but again it’s not uncommon for me to get myself into situations I regret like this. I’ve expressed how I feel about it, I’m choosing to believe that she is sorry and remorseful (choosing because again, I’ll never really know) and I’m moving on. It’s not fair to be taken advantage of, but I also don’t feel like it’s fair for me to be the one who has to report this and take on that process. 

Go easy on me, but this is where I’m at with it. Who knows, I may end up feeling differently about it in the future. Hell even as I write this I’m thinking “did she ever care about my well being? She never contacting me outside of a meeting to check on me. Even after I’d cry in a meeting and tell her I don’t know what to do, and I couldn’t fix my life, I couldn’t control myself. She never texted. It was only when she wanted sex that she went there”. Yeah. Idk. That’s where I’m at. Sorry to let y’all down. 

Thanks again for the validation and support.",mentalhealth,,VA,41.903411,12.4528527
I WENT TO THERAPY FOR THE FIRST TIME,"I had my first therapy session today, and I feel alive. Does that sound weird? 

It was mostly a what do I want to get out of the sessions, kinda thing - cause I'm nearly 18, and it's a child mental health service thing (5 - 18), so we only have about 4 months. 

But it was really therapeutic in a way, even if I was just outlining some of my struggles and basic battles I have with myself daily. Some of the things I said, she shook her head at, like when I said I have no reason to be scared of the fights in my house, cause I'm used to it lol. But yeah...

We came to the conclusion together, that I am fed up of being judged, and wanna change that and the hypocracy in my family. I just don't know how. We agreed that fixing that will hopefully mean I dont have the need to hurt myself, or lash out involuntarily. But that's only gonna be noticeable after a while. So can't comment on that right now. 

Overall I feel a bit optimistic and lighter now... I do urge any of y'all struggling to reach out.  To a friend, a stranger, a teacher. Me... Just please ensure you follow basic safety rules, online and off.",mentalhealth,,kinda,57.9946553,15.8926885
You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?,"I remember feeling pretty smart when I was a kid. Maybe that's just how all kids feel but that's what I remember – getting better grades than most other kids. During my teenage years I didn't work very hard and still got good grades. I even got accepted into a school that only took on students that got good grades. That's when things started to change. Everyone seemed so much smarter than me and it was really scary. I went from feeling like one of the smartest guys in the room to the dumbest – and I'd let myself know just how dumb I was, beating myself up.

Soon, I wasn't just stupid, I was boring. Then I was ugly and weak and pathetic in the eyes of everyone. I felt like I was getting dumber. A brain fog had permeated my mind – I couldn't think as fast. My grades slipped as I worked even less and started playing video games more. Gaming takes up your attention and the thoughts more or less stop.

I still managed to get into a decent university but I was ashamed of my accomplishment because all my classmates were moving on to much more prestigious ones. I lasted two and a half years at uni before the suicidal thoughts started to become a real plan. Scared, friendless and far from home, I decided not to go through with it one night – the worst night of my life. Instead I called my mom late that night and early the next morning I was on a train home.

Since then, I've been living with my mom. I work as a waiter and the job sees a high staff turnover with a majority of people working there being students trying to earn some money in between their studies. I can feel them judging me when I tell them that it's all I do – I'm not doing this part time while I chase my dreams. I don't have anything else going on. I'm a 25yo man living with his mom and working a minimum wage job.

I got help, of course – talking to some professionals and taking pills – but the thoughts never really left. I know I'm not supposed to indulge them. My therapist told me, *you wouldn't say those things to your best friend so why would you say them to yourself?* I would reply that my best friend isn't trying to sabotage and fuck up my life. But I was never trying to do that and yet I felt like I deserved to hear the the things I was telling myself and deserved the life I now had because of how stupid and pathetic I was.

Recently, after doing something stupid but totally forgivable and human, I googled 'Is it possible to get dumber?' The first result was the question: *Is it psychologically possible to get dumber* on Quora. One of the answers by Norma Pellett:

> My experience tells me yes. I know a woman who was articulate and educated. I moved away and saw her again after ten years. She had no opinions of her own and couldn't articulate a decent sentence.

> I asked other friends if she had been ill or in an accident. No, she hadn't. Then I heard her husband talking to her. He called her ”stupid” and told her what she was doing was idiotic. He berated her for several more minutes. She was so cowed by this abuse that she bought into his assessment of her intelligence.
> She became what he expected her to be.
> I was too young and unsure of myself to call him on it or even to try to find a way to help her. I am ashamed that I didn't do anything.
> I'm not even sure that thirty years ago people really thought of emotional abuse as abuse. There were no bruises or broken bones, but this was much worse.
> Don't spend any time with someone who puts you down — not even if they say, “just kidding” or “can't you take a joke?” Months and years of this “humor” can destroy anyone.

Abuse is a terrible thing and I don't want to diminish it or its victims but I couldn't help but compare the husband to the voice in my head. The abuse I put myself through. I imagine having another person tell you those things is a thousand times worse.

I have always thought that a smart person was smart no matter what. That they may not believe it and people might tell them otherwise but they were, unchangeably, smart. Maybe it's obvious to everyone else but it never occurred to me that people could become the person they were told they are. That their personality could be moulded. What my therapist should have told me is *You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?* Thinking of it that way it's hard to feel like I deserve it. There is not a person in the world that I believe deserves abuse.

So how to stop? It's important not to try telling yourself the opposite of the things you usually tell yourself. I'm not going to look in the mirror every day and tell myself I'm smart, confident, handsome etc. That just feels inauthentic and quite silly. What you have to do instead is learn to recognise the thoughts and externalize them – think of them as not your own but rather your anxiety's or your depression's. Your illness is your own personal abuser. Then the next step will be to stop believing the thoughts by not giving them your attention. Don't think the opposite or try to argue with them (e.g. *I'm not ugly I'm beautiful*) instead, try to refocus on whatever it is you were doing. This is hard but can get easier with practice. Mindfulness meditations help. You can even try talking back to the thoughts as though you aren't taking them seriously, *Thanks anxiety, tell me that again! C'mon that's what you always say. Ha, that's a good one. I was hoping you were going to show up.*

I feel so far behind everyone else but I'm going to really try getting better this time.",mentalhealth,,Quora,53.782987399999996,-1.7979356340849026
I think people who make jokes/say that people need to “man up” or “grow a pair” or “be a man” are part of the problem.,"


My friend tried to commit suicide last night. I watched him drive away in his car drunk and he went on the highway/motorway saying he didn’t care if he died. Tried to stop him but couldn’t. That’s not the issue though. 

I had no idea he was suicidal, his family had no idea he was suicidal, his friends had no idea. He’d kept his mouth shut and let these feelings fester. 

The conversation about male mental health is nowhere near what it needs to be. It is heading in the right direction sure, but at the moment it only seems to be a big deal when someone is on the brink of suicide or having severe depression. 

There is no emphasis on normal day to day life, people telling young boys to man up if they are upset. Saying be a man. This is vile behaviour and forces boys to stuff down their feelings and deal with it through anger since they feel they can’t talk it through. Even saying it to girls shows them that this is how they should act and that boys should act differently when it comes to feelings. 

In the US four times as many suicides are by males. 9% have daily anxiety or depression. Of those 9% only a quarter found help for it according to the national health survey 2010-13

In the UK 76% of suicides are carried out by males and 12.5% men are affected by depression. Of the people that seek help through therapy only 36% are men. Then the most shocking stat from the UK, of all the things that kill men under 45, getting hit by a car, murder, heart attacks etc, the leading cause of death is suicide. I am an under 45 male in the UK and to know that the most likely way for me to die statistically is for me to kill myself is shocking and scary. 

Only 15% of men report they would take time off work to focus on mental health. 34% would feel embarrassed or ashamed to do so for a mental health issue compared to the 15% feeling ashamed for a physical injury. 38% would feel that their employer would look down on them for taking time off for a mental health issue compared to the 26% for a physical.

Even among my friends this sort of “man up talk” happens where if a guy gets upset over something deemed trivial he gets told to stop being a girl. I personally am quite sensitive, when I get super angry I tend to tear up. I hate it because it sometimes weakens my argument but it’s just how I am. When I get angry I tear up. It’s not a “sad cry” I’m just angry. 

 I had an argument with a close female friend and she said “I’m only joking, so stop crying and grow a pair, man up”. That says my feelings aren’t allowed because I’m male, because apparently I’m not supposed  to feel that way. I should be calm and collected at all times. But all that does is make my squash my feelings away and deal with them some other way. 

That other way can turn into depression and eventually suicide. 

We need to change the mental health conversation so that it’s not a conversation about men on the brink of suicide. I’m aware that it isn’t only aimed there but at the moment to me it feels like not enough is focused on males feeling  like they *can* talk their problems through with people.",mentalhealth,,US,39.7837304,-100.445882

is my dad slapping my ass sexual assault,"for context, im 16 years old. my dad started ""playfully"" slapping my ass a while ago and at first it was just a silly joke kind of thing between us but then i started getting uncomfortable because he would also say stuff like my ass was too small while touching it. he said that guys liked girls with big butts and that i need to put on some weight. i kindly asked him to stop slapping my ass shortly after that and he got so butthurt, he said that he just wanted us to be close and that it was sad how he couldn't even joke with his own daughter and didn't stop. i made it clear to him that i didn't like it whenever he layed his hands on my ass and my mom would usually be there too, but said nothing. one day i started crying after he did it again and that made him stop. now whenever i bring it up and be like ""hey dad that wasn't very nice of you"", he starts gaslighting me and says that thats not what happened and that i'm making it up. this kinda turned into a vent thing lol im safe now but i just want to know if that counts as sexual assault.

edit: please stop telling me to report him, he didn't molest me, yes it might have escalated but it did not, i'm safe now, i love my dad and seeing people call him a pedo doesn't really help :(",mentalhealth,,kinda,57.9946553,15.8926885
A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness," 

A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness,

If you are reading this as one of **many** who doesn’t understand what it’s like to deal with mental illness, I am very happy you don’t experience firsthand what I and so many others have to experience on a daily basis because...

**I would not wish this pain on my worst enemy.**

**I am so happy** you don’t have to experience feeling that no one in your life truly loves or cares about you, despite them reassuring you that they do on almost a daily basis.

**I am so happy** you haven’t had to answer any of the further questions that follow “do you feel anxious or depressed?” when visiting the doctor’s office.

**I am so happy** you have never thought the world is better without you in it.

If you have never had to leave a party because of a sudden wave of anxiety or sadness, *I really hope it stays that way.*

If you are able to get out of bed without feeling nauseous with anxiety or the weight of depression, *appreciate it* every single day**.**

**Don’t ever take it for granted.**

Don’t let a day go by without appreciating how *beautiful* life is and can be. Because many of us, myself included, aren’t always able to see that beauty, no matter how hard we try.

While mental illness is something that is so wrongfully romanticized in the movies, **it is very ugly in real life.** Mental illness is not **“quirky”** or **“poetic”** like society makes it seem on social media.

Being mentally ill isn’t *aesthetic worthy,* mascara filled tears with sad music in the background; mental illness is barely being able to keep up basic personal hygiene because it feels almost physically **impossible** to get out of bed. 

**Mental illness makes the world seem pointless.** 

So when a loved one approaches you seeking comfort or a listening ear, please don’t automatically assume it is an annoying cry for attention. Because I promise you, that assumption is our **worst fear.**

**The last thing we wish for is to be a burden on the ones we love.**

Isn’t it ironic that even when we are struggling, our first thought is to not make our loved ones uncomfortable?

And when we cancel plans or fail to stay around the entirety of a social outing, don’t take it personally.Trust me, we already beat ourselves up for it enough already because we finally put ourselves first for once, even though that is what we should’ve been doing all along. 

When we isolate ourselves from you and push you away, don’t think it is us being rude. We are just trying to do what we can to feel like we aren’t dragging you down with us.

Please do not blame us for the cards we got dealt, we deal with them the best we are able to, even if it means pushing loved ones away to avoid getting hurt. 

Most of all, see mental illness as you would any broken bone or any physical sickness.**It hurts just as bad and is equally out of our control.**So, while we don’t wish you would first handedly understand, we want you to **be patient** and understand the best you are able to.

**We are fighting an invisible illness that we aren’t always sure we can beat.**

However, even with this ongoing battle to stay afloat in our own minds filled with endless thoughts, **not every single day is a bad one.** 

In fact, we go through periods of time where everything feels alright again for a while. So when those good days finally come around, we appreciate it and never take it for granted. 

Because to those who struggle with mental illness, it is a privilege to feel the true happiness that **everyone** deserves to feel every day.

Sincerely,

The mentally ill",mentalhealth,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
We are asking Congress to take action on the mental health crisis in America.,"Hey guys,

We are a group of high school students who are committed to solving the mental health issues of today through awareness and policy. The mental health crisis is one of the most prevalent issues facing the American population today, not only the youth. 

We are also compiling a list of candidate endorsements who are pledging to focus on mental health reform once they are inaugurated.

In fact, 1 in 5 American adults experience some form of mental illness each year (National Alliance on Mental Illness), while only 41% receive proper treatment (Mental Health First Aid). This is unacceptable, and we demand action now.

We’ve witnessed these problems in our own schools and neighborhoods, and we believe it is time for us as a country to step up and pass bold solutions to protect everyday people. 

We are also asking you to sign and share our petition (https://www.change.org/p/u-s-congress-pass-comprehensive-mental-health-legislation-now ) to ask Congress and the President to commit to comprehensive mental health reform to ensure that everyone has access to quality mental health care.

Thank you.

Edit: Thanks for the overwhelming support, we would never have dreamt of getting almost 350 upvotes in only one day. We have just started a GoFundMe in order to raise money to increase the awareness of this crisis on more platforms such as 
Instagram, Twitter, and Google. The link can be found at (https://www.gofundme.com/f/ask-congress-to-priortize-mental-health?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link-tip&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet). Have a great day!",mentalhealth,,America,39.7837304,-100.445882
My 9-year-old is madly obsessed with me. Any advice?,"&#x200B;

At first it seemed very cute and sweet, like a “Crush” sort of thing. Through this past few years it has been escalating to a point where it is creepy and I fear for her mental health and future safety. I’m telling this story as a way of trying to get some opinions. 

Let’s call her Cindy, she is a daughter of a cousin of mine who I am not that close to, but we still get along pretty well. I’m going to share some anecdotes so you all can see what I mean. 

We come from a family where reunions and parties are common and happen at least once a month. So, we all see each other frequently. Cindy always wants to be around me, she wants me to play with her and hold her every minute of every single reunion. Whenever I dare to hug, say hi, or even acknowledge any other member of the family (especially when it comes to younger females of the family) she would get upset and throw a tantrum, running away onto the streets. Whenever the family starts dancing outside (which is pretty often lol) Cindy makes me pick her up and dance with her. I can only dance with her, no other female is allowed near me, I can’t even put her down to go the bathroom or have a drink. And whenever I did put her down well… temper tantrum time. 

She once smacked her youngest sister (Mia, 2-year-old) so hard it almost knocked her out, just because she was walking around the house, spotted me, smiled, and wanted to get close to say hi. 

Anytime another female of the family would bring me something to eat or drink, she would make me give it back or throw it away so she could go and bring me whatever I had just been given. 

One time I did not show up to one of those reunions because some other plan that sounded more fun came around (dick move I know). Cindy asked everyone a thousand times where I was, and why I wasn’t showing up. Eventually they got tired of her and decided to call me, I explained that I was hanging out with some friends. When they told her about this, she got furious, grabbed a stone and threw it at the nearest car, breaking one of the windows. She then locked herself up inside one of the rooms. 

3 or 4 times a week, Cindy’s mom would call me, telling me Cindy wanted me to come over so I could help her with her homework. Sometimes, her other sister (8-year-old) would ask for my help too, causing Cindy to flip out, throw things at her, and call her names. Whenever I refused the invitation to help Cindy with her hw, she would start ripping her notebooks and textbooks, or pouring water on them. 

She then started to force her parents to bring her to my place every other day, even if it was for a short visit. This One time they left her with me because they needed someone to watch her to do some errands. Cindy was in my room, and I left for a couple of minutes to get her some snacks. When I came back, I found her going thru my clothes. She started crying and said she wanted to steal one of my t-shirts so she could remember me with it. I thought it was kind weird, but cute in a way. I told her she could have one of her choosing. Each time she came over after that she demanded a new shirt to take. I told her I couldn’t give her anymore shirts because I don’t have many. (which is true) Every time she would come, we would have the exact same conversation, until, without me noticing, she took pretty much all my shirts and stuffed them inside her backpack. Her mother had to come back the next day and give them back. 

I used to play along and not say much to her or her mother because, like I said, I thought it just was a “crush” or just a little girl overly attached to an older family member. It escalated gradually to a point which I didn’t know what to do. And besides, I’m really not into confrontation, so I didn’t want to cause any trouble. 

Last time I saw Cindy was this past weekend. (another family reunion) but this time, I brought my new girlfriend with me (she was my best friend for 6 years but I escaped the friendzone haha). Cindy was using crutches because she had gotten injured doing something or other while at school, so she couldn’t follow me around like she usually does. 

Obviously, she got furious when she met my girlfriend, but she didn’t say much. She sat right between us and didn’t let us kiss, hug or dance. Laura (my gf) Went to grab a drink for both of us, and immediately Cindy started moving around so she was occupying the rest of the sofa. When Laura came back, she refused to move and let her sit. I lost my patience (even when I lose my patience, I’m still pretty chill) and told her that she was being mean to my GF and that meant she was also being mean to me. I also told her we (Me and Laura) would have to leave if she kept it up.

Cindy lost it, she started screaming and kicking, she called Laura every name in the book and finished by saying that if we continued being together, she would shoot us both with his father’s gun. Turns out my cousin is not very bright, and it took her this long to realize something might be wrong with her daughter. My cousin pulled me aside and I told her everything, everything I just told you and a lot more. I advised her to seek help for Cindy and told her it was best if I stayed away for a while. 

Im really worried about Cindy and her wellbeing. So please, if anyone has gone thru something similar, or if some of you understand what is going on and what can I do to help. I would gladly listen. 

Thank you. Ps. English is not my first language so sorry if some of the writing is gibberish.",mentalhealth,,Cindy,37.695280790152296,-97.48615065937302
My 9-year-old is madly obsessed with me. Any advice?,"&#x200B;

At first it seemed very cute and sweet, like a “Crush” sort of thing. Through this past few years it has been escalating to a point where it is creepy and I fear for her mental health and future safety. I’m telling this story as a way of trying to get some opinions. 

Let’s call her Cindy, she is a daughter of a cousin of mine who I am not that close to, but we still get along pretty well. I’m going to share some anecdotes so you all can see what I mean. 

We come from a family where reunions and parties are common and happen at least once a month. So, we all see each other frequently. Cindy always wants to be around me, she wants me to play with her and hold her every minute of every single reunion. Whenever I dare to hug, say hi, or even acknowledge any other member of the family (especially when it comes to younger females of the family) she would get upset and throw a tantrum, running away onto the streets. Whenever the family starts dancing outside (which is pretty often lol) Cindy makes me pick her up and dance with her. I can only dance with her, no other female is allowed near me, I can’t even put her down to go the bathroom or have a drink. And whenever I did put her down well… temper tantrum time. 

She once smacked her youngest sister (Mia, 2-year-old) so hard it almost knocked her out, just because she was walking around the house, spotted me, smiled, and wanted to get close to say hi. 

Anytime another female of the family would bring me something to eat or drink, she would make me give it back or throw it away so she could go and bring me whatever I had just been given. 

One time I did not show up to one of those reunions because some other plan that sounded more fun came around (dick move I know). Cindy asked everyone a thousand times where I was, and why I wasn’t showing up. Eventually they got tired of her and decided to call me, I explained that I was hanging out with some friends. When they told her about this, she got furious, grabbed a stone and threw it at the nearest car, breaking one of the windows. She then locked herself up inside one of the rooms. 

3 or 4 times a week, Cindy’s mom would call me, telling me Cindy wanted me to come over so I could help her with her homework. Sometimes, her other sister (8-year-old) would ask for my help too, causing Cindy to flip out, throw things at her, and call her names. Whenever I refused the invitation to help Cindy with her hw, she would start ripping her notebooks and textbooks, or pouring water on them. 

She then started to force her parents to bring her to my place every other day, even if it was for a short visit. This One time they left her with me because they needed someone to watch her to do some errands. Cindy was in my room, and I left for a couple of minutes to get her some snacks. When I came back, I found her going thru my clothes. She started crying and said she wanted to steal one of my t-shirts so she could remember me with it. I thought it was kind weird, but cute in a way. I told her she could have one of her choosing. Each time she came over after that she demanded a new shirt to take. I told her I couldn’t give her anymore shirts because I don’t have many. (which is true) Every time she would come, we would have the exact same conversation, until, without me noticing, she took pretty much all my shirts and stuffed them inside her backpack.

My depression took my personality,"During my (f 20) teenage years I dealt with depression. At some point during that, it became all I was. As many people know depression can make you loose interest in things that previously interested you.
I lost all my hobbies and a big chuck of my personality. I was a shell.

I've since overcome that part of my life and am left with this same shell. I dont particularly have anything that makes me me anymore. I don't have the patience/strength to really finish anything I start (eg artwork or writing) and when I don't finish it it brings me down more.

Essentialy I don't have a personality. I think I'm very boring and have crippling social skills. I don't know how I would go about trying to fix this.

My lack of social skills (due to isolating myself through arguably the most important part of my life, development wise) has also resulted in me loosing all my friends and unable to reconcile or make new ones.

I figure I can't be the only one going through this or something similar and wonder why this big part of this mental illness isn't really talked about

Edit: to add further context. My depression was a big part of who I was as it had such an effect on my life so without it I feel like I don't have anything about myself anymore.",mentalhealth,,Essentialy,43.4498376,-80.488902
I was finally accurately diagnosed after 12 years thanks to the show 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend'," 

Throwaway account for reasons that may be obvious and a **Spoiler** for season 3 of the show.

Let me start off by giving you guys some backstory. I have been in therapy for a wide array of issues: Compulsive spending, depression, anxiety, manic episodes, suicidal attempts. I attempted many times to get a diagnosis but I wouldn't share any embarrassing details that I will share with you. Every psychiatrist I would see would base these disorders off as the result of childhood trauma and an absent father. I was on all the medications you’ve probably heard of Buspar, Prozac, Xanax, and Zoloft. 

My relationships have never really been stable in both interpersonal and romantic areas. I’ve had 3 romantic relationships my entire life with the longest relationship lasting 6 months. Whenever I developed feelings for someone it would turn into severe infatuation where it went as far as stalking, rearranging my work schedule to be able to interact with him, and try to change my physical appearance in order to get them to fall for me. I am not proud of any of this but I need to stop denying that this was happening. With friendships, whenever a friend would cancel plans like drinks at the bar I would fall into a severe depression where suicidal thoughts would come to mind. I would call these friends and tell them I was considering suicide in order to get them to come see me. 

My manic episodes started getting pretty severe over the past few months to the point where I would take a week off from work and take lavish spontaneous trips to Europe, I started having auditory hallucinations of a ‘sane me’ insulting me and calling me crazy. I would go to Vegas on weekends to go on an alcohol binger and have numerous random sexual encounters. I would also lock myself in my room after work and watch TV for 6 hours straight. I will admit, I was too ashamed to open up about this as I was scared of being institutionalized and being known in my family as the freak.

In August, I wanted to start watching a new show and came across the show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. I had heard of the show before but because of the name I thought it was related to the meme I had grown annoyed of so I never really gave it a chance. As I started watching I was horrified that there were a few similarities between myself and the character Rebecca Bunch, the stalking, lavish spending, fear of abandonment, the hallucinations. The fact that she was the titular “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” left me in a slight depression and I almost stopped watching. However when I reached season 3 where Rebecca finally gets diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I decided to finally go to a new psychiatrist to get another opinion and decided not to hold back any information that I was scared would be regarded as ‘crazy’ people behavior. Thanks to the show’s portrayal of mental illness, I was finally able to open up about the stalking, the auditory hallucinations, and everything in between. After 12 years of therapy my official diagnosis is Self-Destructive Borderline and while the road to recovery will be a long one, I am hopeful that someday I will be able to completely manage my BPD. If you're currently going through something similar know that you aren't alone and the medical professionals are there to help you not judge you.

TLDR; Was an undiagnosed Borderline for 12 years but thanks to the show’s portrayal of mental illness I finally opened up about topics I was ashamed to admit, finally getting an accurate diagnosis.",mentalhealth,,Vegas,36.2533896,-115.2794366262601

Men’s Mental Health - I’m here to help,"Hi guys - I’m a 19 year old male who has suffered with severe anxiety, depression, and OCD for over 10 years. I want to end the stigma surrounding men with mental health issues, and help others. 

If there are any men in the group that need a friend, someone to vent to, or anything at all, please message me. I am open to helping anyone, but I feel I’d best be able to help men under 30, just because of my life experiences. For reference, I am located in Virginia, but I’m happy to help anyone anywhere. 

I hope that someone will find this and will have the courage to reach out. My DM’s are a judgement free zone.

I Feel Like Myself Again!,"TODAY, I FEEL LIKE MYSELF AGAIN! I don't know how to explain it! I just feel.... right? For the longest time, I have struggled with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks (without therapy/ suffering in somewhat silence and without support). In addition to this, I had an eating disorder (for 6 and a half months) that took over my life, more than depression, anxiety, and panic attacks every could. I ""broke up"" with my eating disorder 5 days ago. I actually wrote out an entire letter to my ED and put it away. In the letter, I discussed why we were ""breaking up"" and why we should NEVER get back together again. It may sound weird, but, I think it worked. Today marks 2 weeks of my ED being gone. I feel energetic again, unapologetic about eating, and powerful. I feel confident. I feel like me again. My depression has lessened and so has my panic attacks. My anxiety is still not better, though, I've been struggling with that for years. I'm sorry if reading this wasted your time, it's just, I feel so happy and freed. I hope you, the reader of this post, has a magnificent, immaculate, and fantastic morning/ day/ afternoon/ evening/ night/ life in general.

We risk closing and that means that we will lose every cent we even contributed from our own pockets to keep the institutions working. Our patience has run dry. All we need is for our voice to be heard and for greek journalists to notice us.,mentalhealth,,Greece,38.9953683,21.9877132
I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,"Hi everyone, 

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. 

However, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :) 

Thanks.",mentalhealth,,Cycling,59.3452548,18.0484444

Being addicted to daydreaming (Maladaptive daydreaming),"hey um.. I recently found out about this ""disorder"" (i put it in quotes because it is not actually recognized by the DSM)

It is when people daydream very extensively for sometimes hours a day. They create their own highly structured universes and scenarios that help them cope with drama etc.

They often have the urge to that as soon as they wake up. Also while doing that a lot of people engage on repetitive movement (like pacing around). I have heard that psychologists suspect that it activates certain areas in the brain that control your imagination or might effect it in a hypnotic way (((excuse my wording i am not a native speaker lol)))

Those people do NOT gaslight themself. In fact most of MDers are able to tell which of their memories are within their paracosm/imagination and which are not.

Effects of this intense daydreaming is that people with that ""disorder"" sometimes find it very hard to focus on ANYTHING.

Some people argue that daydreaming is natural and MD should not be regarded as a mental illness. I think it certainly has characteristics of a mental illness. It is a coping mechanism at the beginning but at some point MDers find themself daydreaming all day because they got so used to living in this paracosm that they don´t enjoy reality as much anymore. And this is an endless circle. Because if you don´t do stuff with other people or your friends, and avoid your responsibilities and flee in your paracosm your live will get more miserable and your imagined friends, scenarios and word will look more and more appealing.

I recently found out that i might have this ""disorder"". I have stumbled across this because I had problems with not being able to live in the present. A lot of my scenarios are about my future and they are often highly fantastical. So instead of actually doing stuff that might bring me to a future that i might enjoy i just dream about already being there.

Since then i am always searching for new information on this subject and one researcher that does amazing work within this field is Eli Somer. He was the first one who recognized it and publishes a lot of videos about MD on youtube.

Here is his channel: [https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic](https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic)

If you have any thoughts, or further research sources please drop them here. And especially if you have experience with this subject first hand.

I just want people to know that this is real and effects people.

"Oh dear guys! I am SO shocked, surprised, and even happy (-ish)!!!","Slight TW: SH mentioned: NO details though!  


  
Our 18 year old son just came out to me! I was asking him if there are any girls that he is interested in (or thinks is cute) in his CTC classes or his other classes, and he said, ""mmmm...maybe I am not interested in girls"" to which I had said...""ok how about boys?"" He answered ""Mmmm...mayyyyyyybe!""

OMG I am so happy that he feels confident and trusts me enough to tell me that! I told him I don't care who he loves, as long as he is happy. :) Our eldest daughter (the one graduating from college in a few weeks) is in a lesbian relationship, and I remember when she had come out to me at age 17. I said the same thing to her, and we have always been welcoming of anyone she dates.

&#x200B;

I am so proud of our daughter and son. :) Now for the 17 year old...I think he is still aromantic. He doesn't seem to be interested in anyone dating-wise. All 3 of our boys are on the Spectrum and have depression and anxiety, so I have never pushed them to ""find someone"". :) Our eldest has always been more academic than boy-crazy (or girl-crazy in her case), and I just want them to be happy--WHATEVER they end up doing...dating or not dating. :)

I just got my Top Of The Morning candle and hot chocolate in the mail, so my room smells like coffee with vanilla scent...and I feel a little better than I had before. The urge to cut has lessened a LOT, thanks to my Reddit family. :)

<3 As I said, I am forever grateful to all of you! <3

That is all for now. My cockatiel seems to think that I am ignoring her now, so I'd better go and play with her before I put her to bed for the night. :D",mentalhealth,,Mmmm,1.3199803,103.8437969
My life will never be normal again(please read everything... please),"In 2021, everything in my life got fucked up. The results of the happening's in 2021, caused the next 4 years of my life to get ruined as well, Present day 03/31/2025. My life has only been getting worse and worse, day by day its sonething new. Let me explain how life was before 2021, and how life was after 2021, to compare and contrast, and to show you where my life is now. 

2006-2014 I was getting bullied in pre and middle school and had no friends, saw many 8th graders wth girlfriends but I was the quiet awkward kid that was just made fun of, so I didnt even fathom it for me to be a possibility in this lifetime to have a relationship of any kind, which is how fucked up i was from how these kids treated me. 

Then come 2015 high school starts, I don't get bullied but I don't have friends or any place to sit by lunch, so I let shit ride out, I try to get put on benzos for my panic attacks but the doctors won't prescribe benzos to children under 18, so I just deal with the crippling anxiety and panic attacks until I get a schedule change to start in January of 2016.

2016 starts, and who do I see in my new math class, the kid who used to bully me in middle school, but the funniest part is we started chopping it up and we became good friends, to this present day 2025 hes my closest best friend. He introduced me into his friend group and let me sit at their table, he'd also introduced me into trying weed, which i ended up enjoying, and try to smoke as often as I can lmao, we enjoyed the summer of 2016, and even despite not even kissing or having sex with a girl in my life ever(unlike my bestfriend and his friends) I had friends and i belonged so I didn't care, then 2017 arrived it was pretty much the same thing minus the friendgroup who'd abandoned me and my bestfriend, as well as my bestfriends girl leaving my bestfriend for one of the people in the friendgroup which was no longer our friend group. So we hung around a bunch of Randoms my bestfriend was involved with drug dealing wise or just for company. Enough of 2017, moving onto to 2018. 

2018 was the year I met the first girl I fell in love with, we kissed once lmao, and then after that she tried to ghost me because she didn't like the way i kissed, then after fucking a bunch of other guys, she walks up to me in the hallway like nothing happens and tries to be on talking terms, having no one else is fold, so we talk and she starts dropping hint like ""i could teach you how to kiss"" and etc. I brushed it all off because part of me hated this beatfriend with benefits  
position she was trying to put me in, knowing how much I truly loved her. While she'd coochie coo with me and then get her back blown out by like 3 guys behind my back. But I still had feeling for her so I'd talk to her everyday, even when I didn't want to, she was the reason I had so much stress and went from smoking on weekends to a few times throughout the day 24/7. She had changed me in a bad way, much more depressed. 

2019 came, i got my first car ever, but my bestfriend being a fucking dumb ass, decided to drive the car behind my back and ended up wrecking it, it was a bmw with 14 thousand miles only. It was like brands new. I had it for literally 3 days, I was depressed about it, but life happens and eventually I got over it. I went to Florida that summer with my best friend. Had fun working at a sushi place, played basketball in the summer, did many enjoyable things to forget.

Then 2020 came, probably the most peaceful enjoyable year of my life. I got a new car which was faster and the same price as the one that crashed. I started talking to the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid my eyes on, we started off as friends but it was becoming something more, she was a little weird, like sitting at home not leaving her room type, but her beautiful face, her personality, and to not sound perverse, but god given body were 3 thibgs to make this girl a solid 11/10. But then one day my barber was drunk on the job and gave me the wrong fucked up hair cut, so I couldn't ask her out anymore. Months passed by we were still talking everyday, but eventually I realized this is all she wanted. Someone to talk to non stop on the phone, she didn't want to feel real intimacy, real connection, touch, things required for both men and women. So I just let it fade away until we mutually stopped talking together, but while we were talking together, I had lost my virginity(or the only time I've had sex in my life up to this date) while I was talking to the amazing girl I was mentioning above. And all I could think was, it should of have been her, we'll call the first girl(heartbreaker) nyeria, the second girl i actually liked(angel) nichelle, and the girl I lost my virginity too and have never had sex after that(skank)cam. I moved into my best friends grandmas house briefly for like 2 months but it didn't work out being it was a studio.

Those were the years which I thought everything would start becoming better year by year, I had many goals for 2021, but you'll see the downfall start now 

On December 31st 2020, I was burned on accident by a pot of boiling hot pasta water, went to the clinic and everything was fine, I was still healthy and had no problems at this point at my life, everything in my life was organized, from my belongings to my mind(the most important part) 
Then after my leg healed up I started to feel this power within myself, this strong positivity and confidence, like I was on top of the world, I felt more sharp, and focused, healthier, and way happier. I started working out like crazy for the first time in my life, and upon checking my alternative snap, I see that ""nyeria"" added me, so I add her and despite my displeasure, I still had feeling so I started talking to her, she still wanted to have sex and I was finally ready, just needed to get some viagra. 2021 was starting off strong (or so i thought lmao, could not have been more wrong) I rode with the feeling, and then things started happening, like people who'd never give me respect would give me respect, I'd get nice free stuff I'd never even asked for, red-lights would keep turning green, cats would weirdly move out of my way. A series of stuff happening to me that had never really happened before... EVER, so I get into it too much and start watching these spiritual youtubers on YouTube and start taking the things they're saying seriously and trying to apply it to how my life is, sone of it was true some of it wasn't. But ultimately I now feel like im the spiritual man with power, so I start acting a little irrationally. At this point with the power i ""felt i was feeling"" i didnt care about having sex with that girl, even she was my first kiss and first girl I fell in love with etc. It didn't matter at that point, I just felt like more important things were happening. So I stopped smoking weed because the way i was feeling, it couldn't even get me high, I get $50 exactly from someone for something that I used to buy this psychedelic substance called mad honey(because ib my mind i thought the price of the mad honey being $50 and me having $50 meant i was supoosed to purchase this assuming taking mad honey was a part of my spiritual quest. This is the point where everything goes down hill. I take the mad honey and trip hard and attacked my mom, there was no severe damage but I had saw demons and I was scared beyond my life and after attacking her, I somehow end up in my bedroom with lights off bolting outta bed every 10 seconds thinking I'm out of the trip, but I'm still in it, so then officers arrive and crowd into my room and make me get on an ambulance, i get discharged the same day.  Then my dad is rampant of looking for weed rehabs for me so he starts dragging me to these retarded fucking weed rehabs, I think like a good 3 or 4 of them, until I got tired and fed up with visiting those rehabs i wasnt going to go to and decided I'd just live on the road with my parents credit card, so I packed up my script benzos, script codeine and promethazine lean, my hydrocodone, and alcohol in a bag, plus my basketball, and just dipped on them and went to the double tree(who ended up not charging us) then I left the double tree to go to court for my speeding ticket. After that, I made the hugest mistake of my life #1. Follow this Maserati to ask car shop, literally only to ask him where the dispensary is so i could get a med card(being 20 at the time, the bad ugly mother fucking and his demented fat friend made me spell it on a posted note, and I waited for them to come back when in reality I should've just dipped and never came back, instead I was greeted by Lombard police forcing me to get out my car and get onto a fucking ambulance and then for the first time in my life stay at a mental hospital for like 3-4 days I think. I then got out and was sent to this place rosecrance which was very nice. Great all you can eat food, we got cigarettes, pretty counselor, chill guys, nothing really to worry about, but I was a little manic thinking strange thibgs in my head and they could notice it, so they sent me to the mental health facility of rosecrance sons other place, it was alright but nothing as good as the other rosecrance was. In hindsight, I should've just sticked it out and got my head together, figured out I'm not a supernatural guy, or my moms evil, or my dads some type of god, whatever weird shit was going on in my head, but none of this weird shit would've started in my head if these nice coincidences happen, like wanting nicotine and not even looking the girls way and 2 seconds later she offers you nicotine, or girls being sweet on me who would have never before, getting free pizza from the guy who's never done that from the 10 years I had known him at that point(14 now) or the many other things I could mention but have decided to leave it for the sake of getting on with the story. So I asked my parents to pick me up and get me out this rehab place, they reluctantly did. I had odd behavior, like going in the oasis(like a rest area but better) and walking in without my mask because I felt my power could protect me. When we got home my perception was just skewed, I saw my dad as some kind of god like person and my mom as a demonic person. I would just do little harmless weird things around the house. So one day i text nyeria a bunch of hurtful things and she blocks me, i do ot hecause im sexretly convinced shes a demon of some kind or my secret hapf sister no ones told us about, she did kind of look like me. So one day i make the mistake of unadding a bunch people on snapchat, because I'm thinking that they're demons or people on the dark side... I removed ""nichelle"" of my snapchat, the girl I liked the absolute most more than anyone, the girl im still in love with to this day. The most beautiful perfect girl in this world. While I was in my mind state I didnt think anything of it. So the damage i had caused myself had been bad but was undeniably gonna become worse, lost an easy good looking bootycall, and lost the love of my life who i was waiting for the right time to rekindle things with, but becoming manic can happen outta nothing. So the next day my mom makes food and I'm paranoid she's poisoned it, and try to throw it outside, but my dad stops me, he then tells me were going a trip, he lies and brings me to the mental hospital, where this faggot tall fat big pussy bitch forces me to strip into a gown or hell get people to hold me down and do it. They then leave me in that hospital for 10 days with multiple fucked antipsychotics that don't help me feel less antisychotic, because in reality, I was just a boy on the Autism spectrum drawing conclusions from coincidences or special stuff that normally doesn't happen to the extent of it happening being crazy in my eyes leading me to think from one thing to another forming nonsensical ideas and skewing my perception. All the antipsychotics did was make me gain weight, get headaches, and make me depressed. After I got out of hospital #2 my dad told me in the car he'd threw out $5000+ worth of my codeine and promethazine syrup, that I was going to be forced to go to outpatient for weed even i hadn't been smoking it for like a month, and he had kept my car in someone's driveway for a couple months ""till I deserve it again"" almost forgot, he rearranged my room and threw away a bunch of my weed paraphernalia, other stuff that was important to me not related to weed. Then he started forcing me to get vaccinated, I told him a hundred times I'd won't but he'd keep bothering me like on some really obsessive creepy shit, so after a month of bothering, I went against my fears and got one shot only, never any after that. I regretted it so much, and I was someone mad about putting that fucked up poison in my body especially after everything i had already went through, this was the worst thing, because i could've lost relationships with beautiful women, i could've lost material possessions, money, designer drugs, and privilege of using a car, but my health was the most important thing to me, and they fucked that for me, those stupid fucking scared Indians want to shove needles up their ass and get blood clots a d cancer and die cuz they're fuxkibg stupid and don't understand thr vaccine was solely created to kill us, I was forced into taking it by them, so the love i had for my father disappeared, I hated him now for fucking my life up. 

Then 2022 came, I moved out and was chronically depressed since 2021, which is when it started May 16th,2021 after I got the vaccine. I couldn't look my friends in the eyes anymore have full conversations, feel present, smoke weed without getting anxiety, thinking about how i lost nyeria and nichelle(these are made up names to protect their real identities) I was slightly fat. The main thing i enjoyed doing was smoking weed and after the trauma of losing my lean, weed stuff, car, the 2 girls i could've had in my life, my health due to the vaccine, it was all too much so I just stayed away from weed from that point, until like a week later I fell into a pit of buying dispensary dab carts and poshes(vapes) and smo king them everyday ro ease my pain, and not see my parents. But to sum it up my bestfriends house was too dirty to stay in, so I moved out and started hanging out with the spiritual kid who made me lose 30 pounds, and things were going good until the feeling of power came back, I started not only feeling this new feeling of power, but a new add to the mix was that my mom was lightskin black and somehow I was gabgmember and part of the black p stones. I really in my mind drew this conclusion outta things that I really don't want to get into right now, but that was the case 

2023 was the same, living of the idea my ""real"" mom is a gangmember and my ""fake"" real mom is my stepmother, I just drove around not doing shit, hanging out with friends, going to the gym, doing drugs, the same old,(by the way i had a job in 2022 around the time i started losing my marbles again, but that doesn't matter."") One day i decide to do stunts in the basement and injure my shoulder, then when I come home I'm getting this special sense that I need to jump off the balcony, so i do; and in that exact moments the cop arrives, sick of their bs i don't want to respond to them, i didn't hurt anyone and its not their house so they can go fuck themselves, so basically I get intuition that I need to go to jail to by myself so I just punch the officer and end up going to jail where some of the deputy's treat me like a king, and some treat me like the garbage they themselves are (example beebee) but his son the other beebee was cool. Wrong, grote, strezlecki, the goats no one better than them. But then in November 2023 I get transferred to a fucking mental psych ward near Missouri 

They say I have pschitzoeffective, which i never did and don't, and put ke on fuckec up halidol and depakote where the haldol made me go from 144 pounds 5'11 to 189 pounds 5'11. Worse than that, every single day I'd get these out of body side effects, which were like going through hell times 11. But there was nothing I could do there. They beat people up there, and it was one to get beaten on the suspicion that I was spitting out my poisin medication but really it was my phlegm. There were many other bad things about but I'm not really going to go over those rn, have questions dm me. So 8 months in jail, 6 months in the hospital I'm out on bond, before I get accepted into mental health probation. The terms of my probation are driving all the way up to Wheaton twice a week just to piss, multiple court dates, probation officer meeting, and no drugs of any kind including alcohol, unless you can get a med card but i doubt mental health probation will allow that. Hopefully im through with probation ny November 16th 2025. I'm sick all of this shit 

So this is where I'm at present, i have completed no college, I used to get women in the past, but with all of the trauma I been through i hate myself and dont see myself seeking the comfort of any woman in this life time, i was 195 pounds with a big gut, my dad crashed my car while I was in jail so now I have no car, the whole reason I went to the jail and became a viral video with over 100 million views is hecause my parents decided to call the cops and new I was unstable and would do something to them to end up in jail, I lost the 2 only girls that I could've had any relationship with, my confidence is ruined from going to jails and hospitals. They're trying to lable me as Schitzo-effective and prescribe me those fucked up meds like haldol or abilify which have side effect like weight gain, head aches, and out of body attacks(being the worst side effext), and erectile dysfunction. I actually stopped taking those pills 2 months ago completely, and i still have erectyle dysfunction.I don't need these medications when I'm just a normal depressed guy realizing that I had lost my mind twice, and have come to terms wirh it. I lost my $5000 in codeine lean, I don't enjoy music anymore, i feel an empty void in my life, i have no motivation for living anymore, I hate myself and I have no self confidence, i don't look good anymore, I can barely get my dick up, I can't talk to girls, only ones I had a connection with and they're both gone forever. I'm stuck on probation, I'm 24 without a car, I'm fat depressed and overweight with erectile dysfunction, my psychiatrist i trying to stop lorazepam(the only medication which is supposed to be for my anxiety and pannic attacks) I don't want to be alive anymore, so much of my life has gone to shit, there's so much I didnt mention in these paragraphs because it was hard to incorporate the whole story. I am missing about 40%. So try to go off what you read. I keep praying we will get one redo with life, but it just doesn't seem possible, but at the same time, it does. Before 2021 I had everything i needed, I had the perfect life, not a single complaint, my body was right and my mind even righter, it's just sad to watch thibgs crumble before your very eyes. Have something beautiful, and just watch it turn completely to shit. I could've had any better relationship with my family. I would've had women in my life. I would have had my personal belongings, which meant a lot to me. I would've had my car. I would've been. In good health and in good shape, plus looked good too, I would've interest in my life, anx motivation to move forward, but i have none of that anymore.

My fellow human beings, do you feel we get one more redo at life from birth, to do everything right and perhaps make different or better mistakes, not the fucked up ones we made in this lifetime, I know it sounds stupid as fuck, but deep down I can't be the only one feeling this way, with a desire for a redo at life.

Maybe we're just better of killing ourselves, who even knows, because i can't keep going on with this life.

My life will never be normal again(please read everything... please),"In 2021, everything in my life got fucked up. The results of the happening's in 2021, caused the next 4 years of my life to get ruined as well, Present day 03/31/2025. My life has only been getting worse and worse, day by day its sonething new. Let me explain how life was before 2021, and how life was after 2021, to compare and contrast, and to show you where my life is now. 

2006-2014 I was getting bullied in pre and middle school and had no friends, saw many 8th graders wth girlfriends but I was the quiet awkward kid that was just made fun of, so I didnt even fathom it for me to be a possibility in this lifetime to have a relationship of any kind, which is how fucked up i was from how these kids treated me. 

Then come 2015 high school starts, I don't get bullied but I don't have friends or any place to sit by lunch, so I let shit ride out, I try to get put on benzos for my panic attacks but the doctors won't prescribe benzos to children under 18, so I just deal with the crippling anxiety and panic attacks until I get a schedule change to start in January of 2016.

2016 starts, and who do I see in my new math class, the kid who used to bully me in middle school, but the funniest part is we started chopping it up and we became good friends, to this present day 2025 hes my closest best friend. He introduced me into his friend group and let me sit at their table, he'd also introduced me into trying weed, which i ended up enjoying, and try to smoke as often as I can lmao, we enjoyed the summer of 2016, and even despite not even kissing or having sex with a girl in my life ever(unlike my bestfriend and his friends) I had friends and i belonged so I didn't care, then 2017 arrived it was pretty much the same thing minus the friendgroup who'd abandoned me and my bestfriend, as well as my bestfriends girl leaving my bestfriend for one of the people in the friendgroup which was no longer our friend group. So we hung around a bunch of Randoms my bestfriend was involved with drug dealing wise or just for company. Enough of 2017, moving onto to 2018. 

2018 was the year I met the first girl I fell in love with, we kissed once lmao, and then after that she tried to ghost me because she didn't like the way i kissed, then after fucking a bunch of other guys, she walks up to me in the hallway like nothing happens and tries to be on talking terms, having no one else is fold, so we talk and she starts dropping hint like ""i could teach you how to kiss"" and etc. I brushed it all off because part of me hated this beatfriend with benefits  
position she was trying to put me in, knowing how much I truly loved her. While she'd coochie coo with me and then get her back blown out by like 3 guys behind my back. But I still had feeling for her so I'd talk to her everyday, even when I didn't want to, she was the reason I had so much stress and went from smoking on weekends to a few times throughout the day 24/7. She had changed me in a bad way, much more depressed. 

2019 came, i got my first car ever, but my bestfriend being a fucking dumb ass, decided to drive the car behind my back and ended up wrecking it, it was a bmw with 14 thousand miles only. It was like brands new. I had it for literally 3 days, I was depressed about it, but life happens and eventually I got over it. I went to Florida that summer with my best friend. Had fun working at a sushi place, played basketball in the summer, did many enjoyable things to forget.

Then 2020 came, probably the most peaceful enjoyable year of my life. I got a new car which was faster and the same price as the one that crashed. I started talking to the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid my eyes on, we started off as friends but it was becoming something more, she was a little weird, like sitting at home not leaving her room type, but her beautiful face, her personality, and to not sound perverse, but god given body were 3 thibgs to make this girl a solid 11/10. But then one day my barber was drunk on the job and gave me the wrong fucked up hair cut, so I couldn't ask her out anymore. Months passed by we were still talking everyday, but eventually I realized this is all she wanted. Someone to talk to non stop on the phone, she didn't want to feel real intimacy, real connection, touch, things required for both men and women. So I just let it fade away until we mutually stopped talking together, but while we were talking together, I had lost my virginity(or the only time I've had sex in my life up to this date) while I was talking to the amazing girl I was mentioning above. And all I could think was, it should of have been her, we'll call the first girl(heartbreaker) nyeria, the second girl i actually liked(angel) nichelle, and the girl I lost my virginity too and have never had sex after that(skank)cam. I moved into my best friends grandmas house briefly for like 2 months but it didn't work out being it was a studio.

Those were the years which I thought everything would start becoming better year by year, I had many goals for 2021, but you'll see the downfall start now 

On December 31st 2020, I was burned on accident by a pot of boiling hot pasta water, went to the clinic and everything was fine, I was still healthy and had no problems at this point at my life, everything in my life was organized, from my belongings to my mind(the most important part) 
Then after my leg healed up I started to feel this power within myself, this strong positivity and confidence, like I was on top of the world, I felt more sharp, and focused, healthier, and way happier. I started working out like crazy for the first time in my life, and upon checking my alternative snap, I see that ""nyeria"" added me, so I add her and despite my displeasure, I still had feeling so I started talking to her, she still wanted to have sex and I was finally ready, just needed to get some viagra. 2021 was starting off strong (or so i thought lmao, could not have been more wrong) I rode with the feeling, and then things started happening, like people who'd never give me respect would give me respect, I'd get nice free stuff I'd never even asked for, red-lights would keep turning green, cats would weirdly move out of my way. A series of stuff happening to me that had never really happened before... EVER, so I get into it too much and start watching these spiritual youtubers on YouTube and start taking the things they're saying seriously and trying to apply it to how my life is, sone of it was true some of it wasn't. But ultimately I now feel like im the spiritual man with power, so I start acting a little irrationally. At this point with the power i ""felt i was feeling"" i didnt care about having sex with that girl, even she was my first kiss and first girl I fell in love with etc. It didn't matter at that point, I just felt like more important things were happening. So I stopped smoking weed because the way i was feeling, it couldn't even get me high, I get $50 exactly from someone for something that I used to buy this psychedelic substance called mad honey(because ib my mind i thought the price of the mad honey being $50 and me having $50 meant i was supoosed to purchase this assuming taking mad honey was a part of my spiritual quest. This is the point where everything goes down hill. I take the mad honey and trip hard and attacked my mom, there was no severe damage but I had saw demons and I was scared beyond my life and after attacking her, I somehow end up in my bedroom with lights off bolting outta bed every 10 seconds thinking I'm out of the trip, but I'm still in it, so then officers arrive and crowd into my room and make me get on an ambulance, i get discharged the same day.  Then my dad is rampant of looking for weed rehabs for me so he starts dragging me to these retarded fucking weed rehabs, I think like a good 3 or 4 of them, until I got tired and fed up with visiting those rehabs i wasnt going to go to and decided I'd just live on the road with my parents credit card, so I packed up my script benzos, script codeine and promethazine lean, my hydrocodone, and alcohol in a bag, plus my basketball, and just dipped on them and went to the double tree(who ended up not charging us) then I left the double tree to go to court for my speeding ticket. After that, I made the hugest mistake of my life #1. Follow this Maserati to ask car shop, literally only to ask him where the dispensary is so i could get a med card(being 20 at the time, the bad ugly mother fucking and his demented fat friend made me spell it on a posted note, and I waited for them to come back when in reality I should've just dipped and never came back, instead I was greeted by Lombard police forcing me to get out my car and get onto a fucking ambulance and then for the first time in my life stay at a mental hospital for like 3-4 days I think. I then got out and was sent to this place rosecrance which was very nice. Great all you can eat food, we got cigarettes, pretty counselor, chill guys, nothing really to worry about, but I was a little manic thinking strange thibgs in my head and they could notice it, so they sent me to the mental health facility of rosecrance sons other place, it was alright but nothing as good as the other rosecrance was. In hindsight, I should've just sticked it out and got my head together, figured out I'm not a supernatural guy, or my moms evil, or my dads some type of god, whatever weird shit was going on in my head, but none of this weird shit would've started in my head if these nice coincidences happen, like wanting nicotine and not even looking the girls way and 2 seconds later she offers you nicotine, or girls being sweet on me who would have never before, getting free pizza from the guy who's never done that from the 10 years I had known him at that point(14 now) or the many other things I could mention but have decided to leave it for the sake of getting on with the story. So I asked my parents to pick me up and get me out this rehab place, they reluctantly did. I had odd behavior, like going in the oasis(like a rest area but better) and walking in without my mask because I felt my power could protect me. When we got home my perception was just skewed, I saw my dad as some kind of god like person and my mom as a demonic person. I would just do little harmless weird things around the house. So one day i text nyeria a bunch of hurtful things and she blocks me, i do ot hecause im sexretly convinced shes a demon of some kind or my secret hapf sister no ones told us about, she did kind of look like me. So one day i make the mistake of unadding a bunch people on snapchat, because I'm thinking that they're demons or people on the dark side... I removed ""nichelle"" of my snapchat, the girl I liked the absolute most more than anyone, the girl im still in love with to this day. The most beautiful perfect girl in this world. While I was in my mind state I didnt think anything of it. So the damage i had caused myself had been bad but was undeniably gonna become worse, lost an easy good looking bootycall, and lost the love of my life who i was waiting for the right time to rekindle things with, but becoming manic can happen outta nothing. So the next day my mom makes food and I'm paranoid she's poisoned it, and try to throw it outside, but my dad stops me, he then tells me were going a trip, he lies and brings me to the mental hospital, where this faggot tall fat big pussy bitch forces me to strip into a gown or hell get people to hold me down and do it. They then leave me in that hospital for 10 days with multiple fucked antipsychotics that don't help me feel less antisychotic, because in reality, I was just a boy on the Autism spectrum drawing conclusions from coincidences or special stuff that normally doesn't happen to the extent of it happening being crazy in my eyes leading me to think from one thing to another forming nonsensical ideas and skewing my perception. All the antipsychotics did was make me gain weight, get headaches, and make me depressed. After I got out of hospital #2 my dad told me in the car he'd threw out $5000+ worth of my codeine and promethazine syrup, that I was going to be forced to go to outpatient for weed even i hadn't been smoking it for like a month, and he had kept my car in someone's driveway for a couple months ""till I deserve it again"" almost forgot, he rearranged my room and threw away a bunch of my weed paraphernalia, other stuff that was important to me not related to weed. Then he started forcing me to get vaccinated, I told him a hundred times I'd won't but he'd keep bothering me like on some really obsessive creepy shit, so after a month of bothering, I went against my fears and got one shot only, never any after that. I regretted it so much, and I was someone mad about putting that fucked up poison in my body especially after everything i had already went through, this was the worst thing, because i could've lost relationships with beautiful women, i could've lost material possessions, money, designer drugs, and privilege of using a car, but my health was the most important thing to me, and they fucked that for me, those stupid fucking scared Indians want to shove needles up their ass and get blood clots a d cancer and die cuz they're fuxkibg stupid and don't understand thr vaccine was solely created to kill us, I was forced into taking it by them, so the love i had for my father disappeared, I hated him now for fucking my life up. 

Then 2022 came, I moved out and was chronically depressed since 2021, which is when it started May 16th,2021 after I got the vaccine. I couldn't look my friends in the eyes anymore have full conversations, feel present, smoke weed without getting anxiety, thinking about how i lost nyeria and nichelle(these are made up names to protect their real identities) I was slightly fat. The main thing i enjoyed doing was smoking weed and after the trauma of losing my lean, weed stuff, car, the 2 girls i could've had in my life, my health due to the vaccine, it was all too much so I just stayed away from weed from that point, until like a week later I fell into a pit of buying dispensary dab carts and poshes(vapes) and smo king them everyday ro ease my pain, and not see my parents. But to sum it up my bestfriends house was too dirty to stay in, so I moved out and started hanging out with the spiritual kid who made me lose 30 pounds, and things were going good until the feeling of power came back, I started not only feeling this new feeling of power, but a new add to the mix was that my mom was lightskin black and somehow I was gabgmember and part of the black p stones. I really in my mind drew this conclusion outta things that I really don't want to get into right now, but that was the case 

2023 was the same, living of the idea my ""real"" mom is a gangmember and my ""fake"" real mom is my stepmother, I just drove around not doing shit, hanging out with friends, going to the gym, doing drugs, the same old,(by the way i had a job in 2022 around the time i started losing my marbles again, but that doesn't matter."") One day i decide to do stunts in the basement and injure my shoulder, then when I come home I'm getting this special sense that I need to jump off the balcony, so i do; and in that exact moments the cop arrives, sick of their bs i don't want to respond to them, i didn't hurt anyone and its not their house so they can go fuck themselves, so basically I get intuition that I need to go to jail to by myself so I just punch the officer and end up going to jail where some of the deputy's treat me like a king, and some treat me like the garbage they themselves are (example beebee) but his son the other beebee was cool. Wrong, grote, strezlecki, the goats no one better than them. But then in November 2023 I get transferred to a fucking mental psych ward near Missouri 

They say I have pschitzoeffective, which i never did and don't, and put ke on fuckec up halidol and depakote where the haldol made me go from 144 pounds 5'11 to 189 pounds 5'11. Worse than that, every single day I'd get these out of body side effects, which were like going through hell times 11. But there was nothing I could do there. They beat people up there, and it was one to get beaten on the suspicion that I was spitting out my poisin medication but really it was my phlegm. There were many other bad things about but I'm not really going to go over those rn, have questions dm me. So 8 months in jail, 6 months in the hospital I'm out on bond, before I get accepted into mental health probation. The terms of my probation are driving all the way up to Wheaton twice a week just to piss, multiple court dates, probation officer meeting, and no drugs of any kind including alcohol, unless you can get a med card but i doubt mental health probation will allow that. Hopefully im through with probation ny November 16th 2025. I'm sick all of this shit 

So this is where I'm at present, i have completed no college, I used to get women in the past, but with all of the trauma I been through i hate myself and dont see myself seeking the comfort of any woman in this life time, i was 195 pounds with a big gut, my dad crashed my car while I was in jail so now I have no car, the whole reason I went to the jail and became a viral video with over 100 million views is hecause my parents decided to call the cops and new I was unstable and would do something to them to end up in jail, I lost the 2 only girls that I could've had any relationship with, my confidence is ruined from going to jails and hospitals.

I'm stuck on probation, I'm 24 without a car, I'm fat depressed and overweight with erectile dysfunction, my psychiatrist i trying to stop lorazepam(the only medication which is supposed to be for my anxiety and pannic attacks) I don't want to be alive anymore, so much of my life has gone to shit, there's so much I didnt mention in these paragraphs because it was hard to incorporate the whole story.

My fellow human beings, do you feel we get one more redo at life from birth, to do everything right and perhaps make different or better mistakes, not the fucked up ones we made in this lifetime, I know it sounds stupid as fuck, but deep down I can't be the only one feeling this way, with a desire for a redo at life.

Maybe we're just better of killing ourselves, who even knows, because i can't keep going on with this life.

Then my dad is rampant of looking for weed rehabs for me so he starts dragging me to these retarded fucking weed rehabs, I think like a good 3 or 4 of them, until I got tired and fed up with visiting those rehabs i wasnt going to go to and decided I'd just live on the road with my parents credit card, so I packed up my script benzos, script codeine and promethazine lean, my hydrocodone, and alcohol in a bag, plus my basketball, and just dipped on them and went to the double tree(who ended up not charging us) then I left the double tree to go to court for my speeding ticket. After that, I made the hugest mistake of my life #1. Follow this Maserati to ask car shop, literally only to ask him where the dispensary is so i could get a med card(being 20 at the time, the bad ugly mother fucking and his demented fat friend made me spell it on a posted note, and I waited for them to come back when in reality I should've just dipped and never came back, instead I was greeted by Lombard police forcing me to get out my car and get onto a fucking ambulance and then for the first time in my life stay at a mental hospital for like 3-4 days I think. I then got out and was sent to this place rosecrance which was very nice. Great all you can eat food, we got cigarettes, pretty counselor, chill guys, nothing really to worry about, but I was a little manic thinking strange thibgs in my head and they could notice it, so they sent me to the mental health facility of rosecrance sons other place, it was alright but nothing as good as the other rosecrance was. In hindsight, I should've just sticked it out and got my head together, figured out I'm not a supernatural guy, or my moms evil, or my dads some type of god, whatever weird shit was going on in my head, but none of this weird shit would've started in my head if these nice coincidences happen, like wanting nicotine and not even looking the girls way and 2 seconds later she offers you nicotine, or girls being sweet on me who would have never before, getting free pizza from the guy who's never done that from the 10 years I had known him at that point(14 now) or the many other things I could mention but have decided to leave it for the sake of getting on with the story. So I asked my parents to pick me up and get me out this rehab place, they reluctantly did. I had odd behavior, like going in the oasis(like a rest area but better) and walking in without my mask because I felt my power could protect me. When we got home my perception was just skewed, I saw my dad as some kind of god like person and my mom as a demonic person. I would just do little harmless weird things around the house. So one day i text nyeria a bunch of hurtful things and she blocks me, i do ot hecause im sexretly convinced shes a demon of some kind or my secret hapf sister no ones told us about, she did kind of look like me. So one day i make the mistake of unadding a bunch people on snapchat, because I'm thinking that they're demons or people on the dark side... I removed ""nichelle"" of my snapchat, the girl I liked the absolute most more than anyone, the girl im still in love with to this day. The most beautiful perfect girl in this world. While I was in my mind state I didnt think anything of it. So the damage i had caused myself had been bad but was undeniably gonna become worse, lost an easy good looking bootycall, and lost the love of my life who i was waiting for the right time to rekindle things with, but becoming manic can happen outta nothing. So the next day my mom makes food and I'm paranoid she's poisoned it, and try to throw it outside, but my dad stops me, he then tells me were going a trip, he lies and brings me to the mental hospital, where this faggot tall fat big pussy bitch forces me to strip into a gown or hell get people to hold me down and do it. They then leave me in that hospital for 10 days with multiple fucked antipsychotics that don't help me feel less antisychotic, because in reality, I was just a boy on the Autism spectrum drawing conclusions from coincidences or special stuff that normally doesn't happen to the extent of it happening being crazy in my eyes leading me to think from one thing to another forming nonsensical ideas and skewing my perception. All the antipsychotics did was make me gain weight, get headaches, and make me depressed. After I got out of hospital #2 my dad told me in the car he'd threw out $5000+ worth of my codeine and promethazine syrup, that I was going to be forced to go to outpatient for weed even i hadn't been smoking it for like a month, and he had kept my car in someone's driveway for a couple months ""till I deserve it again"" almost forgot, he rearranged my room and threw away a bunch of my weed paraphernalia, other stuff that was important to me not related to weed. Then he started forcing me to get vaccinated, I told him a hundred times I'd won't but he'd keep bothering me like on some really obsessive creepy shit, so after a month of bothering, I went against my fears and got one shot only, never any after that. I regretted it so much, and I was someone mad about putting that fucked up poison in my body especially after everything i had already went through, this was the worst thing, because i could've lost relationships with beautiful women, i could've lost material possessions, money, designer drugs, and privilege of using a car, but my health was the most important thing to me, and they fucked that for me, those stupid fucking scared Indians want to shove needles up their ass and get blood clots a d cancer and die cuz they're fuxkibg stupid and don't understand thr vaccine was solely created to kill us, I was forced into taking it by them, so the love i had for my father disappeared, I hated him now for fucking my life up. 

Then 2022 came, I moved out and was chronically depressed since 2021, which is when it started May 16th,2021 after I got the vaccine. I couldn't look my friends in the eyes anymore have full conversations, feel present, smoke weed without getting anxiety, thinking about how i lost nyeria and nichelle(these are made up names to protect their real identities) I was slightly fat. The main thing i enjoyed doing was smoking weed and after the trauma of losing my lean, weed stuff, car, the 2 girls i could've had in my life, my health due to the vaccine, it was all too much so I just stayed away from weed from that point, until like a week later I fell into a pit of buying dispensary dab carts and poshes(vapes) and smo king them everyday ro ease my pain, and not see my parents. But to sum it up my bestfriends house was too dirty to stay in, so I moved out and started hanging out with the spiritual kid who made me lose 30 pounds, and things were going good until the feeling of power came back, I started not only feeling this new feeling of power, but a new add to the mix was that my mom was lightskin black and somehow I was gabgmember and part of the black p stones. I really in my mind drew this conclusion outta things that I really don't want to get into right now, but that was the case 

2023 was the same, living of the idea my ""real"" mom is a gangmember and my ""fake"" real mom is my stepmother, I just drove around not doing shit, hanging out with friends, going to the gym, doing drugs, the same old,(by the way i had a job in 2022 around the time i started losing my marbles again, but that doesn't matter."") One day i decide to do stunts in the basement and injure my shoulder, then when I come home I'm getting this special sense that I need to jump off the balcony, so i do; and in that exact moments the cop arrives, sick of their bs i don't want to respond to them, i didn't hurt anyone and its not their house so they can go fuck themselves, so basically I get intuition that I need to go to jail to by myself so I just punch the officer and end up going to jail where some of the deputy's treat me like a king, and some treat me like the garbage they themselves are (example beebee) but his son the other beebee was cool. Wrong, grote, strezlecki, the goats no one better than them. But then in November 2023 I get transferred to a fucking mental psych ward near Missouri 

They say I have pschitzoeffective, which i never did and don't, and put ke on fuckec up halidol and depakote where the haldol made me go from 144 pounds 5'11 to 189 pounds 5'11. Worse than that, every single day I'd get these out of body side effects, which were like going through hell times 11. But there was nothing I could do there. They beat people up there, and it was one to get beaten on the suspicion that I was spitting out my poisin medication but really it was my phlegm. There were many other bad things about but I'm not really going to go over those rn, have questions dm me. So 8 months in jail, 6 months in the hospital I'm out on bond, before I get accepted into mental health probation. The terms of my probation are driving all the way up to Wheaton twice a week just to piss, multiple court dates, probation officer meeting, and no drugs of any kind including alcohol, unless you can get a med card but i doubt mental health probation will allow that. Hopefully im through with probation ny November 16th 2025. I'm sick all of this shit 

So this is where I'm at present, i have completed no college, I used to get women in the past, but with all of the trauma I been through i hate myself and dont see myself seeking the comfort of any woman in this life time, i was 195 pounds with a big gut, my dad crashed my car while I was in jail so now I have no car, the whole reason I went to the jail and became a viral video with over 100 million views is hecause my parents decided to call the cops and new I was unstable and would do something to them to end up in jail, I lost the 2 only girls that I could've had any relationship with, my confidence is ruined from going to jails and hospitals. They're trying to lable me as Schitzo-effective and prescribe me those fucked up meds like haldol or abilify which have side effect like weight gain, head aches, and out of body attacks(being the worst side effext), and erectile dysfunction. I actually stopped taking those pills 2 months ago completely, and i still have erectyle dysfunction.I don't need these medications when I'm just a normal depressed guy realizing that I had lost my mind twice, and have come to terms wirh it. I lost my $5000 in codeine lean, I don't enjoy music anymore, i feel an empty void in my life, i have no motivation for living anymore, I hate myself and I have no self confidence, i don't look good anymore, I can barely get my dick up, I can't talk to girls, only ones I had a connection with and they're both gone forever. I'm stuck on probation, I'm 24 without a car, I'm fat depressed and overweight with erectile dysfunction, my psychiatrist i trying to stop lorazepam(the only medication which is supposed to be for my anxiety and pannic attacks) I don't want to be alive anymore, so much of my life has gone to shit, there's so much I didnt mention in these paragraphs because it was hard to incorporate the whole story. I am missing about 40%. So try to go off what you read. I keep praying we will get one redo with life, but it just doesn't seem possible, but at the same time, it does. Before 2021 I had everything i needed, I had the perfect life, not a single complaint, my body was right and my mind even righter, it's just sad to watch thibgs crumble before your very eyes. Have something beautiful, and just watch it turn completely to shit. I could've had any better relationship with my family. I would've had women in my life. I would have had my personal belongings, which meant a lot to me. I would've had my car. I would've been. In good health and in good shape, plus looked good too, I would've interest in my life, anx motivation to move forward, but i have none of that anymore.

My fellow human beings, do you feel we get one more redo at life from birth, to do everything right and perhaps make different or better mistakes, not the fucked up ones we made in this lifetime, I know it sounds stupid as fuck, but deep down I can't be the only one feeling this way, with a desire for a redo at life.

Maybe we're just better of killing ourselves, who even knows, because i can't keep going on with this life.

My life will never be normal again(please read everything... please),"In 2021, everything in my life got fucked up. The results of the happening's in 2021, caused the next 4 years of my life to get ruined as well, Present day 03/31/2025. My life has only been getting worse and worse, day by day its sonething new. Let me explain how life was before 2021, and how life was after 2021, to compare and contrast, and to show you where my life is now. 

2006-2014 I was getting bullied in pre and middle school and had no friends, saw many 8th graders wth girlfriends but I was the quiet awkward kid that was just made fun of, so I didnt even fathom it for me to be a possibility in this lifetime to have a relationship of any kind, which is how fucked up i was from how these kids treated me. 

Then come 2015 high school starts, I don't get bullied but I don't have friends or any place to sit by lunch, so I let shit ride out, I try to get put on benzos for my panic attacks but the doctors won't prescribe benzos to children under 18, so I just deal with the crippling anxiety and panic attacks until I get a schedule change to start in January of 2016.

2016 starts, and who do I see in my new math class, the kid who used to bully me in middle school, but the funniest part is we started chopping it up and we became good friends, to this present day 2025 hes my closest best friend. He introduced me into his friend group and let me sit at their table, he'd also introduced me into trying weed, which i ended up enjoying, and try to smoke as often as I can lmao, we enjoyed the summer of 2016, and even despite not even kissing or having sex with a girl in my life ever(unlike my bestfriend and his friends) I had friends and i belonged so I didn't care, then 2017 arrived it was pretty much the same thing minus the friendgroup who'd abandoned me and my bestfriend, as well as my bestfriends girl leaving my bestfriend for one of the people in the friendgroup which was no longer our friend group. So we hung around a bunch of Randoms my bestfriend was involved with drug dealing wise or just for company. Enough of 2017, moving onto to 2018. 

2018 was the year I met the first girl I fell in love with, we kissed once lmao, and then after that she tried to ghost me because she didn't like the way i kissed, then after fucking a bunch of other guys, she walks up to me in the hallway like nothing happens and tries to be on talking terms, having no one else is fold, so we talk and she starts dropping hint like ""i could teach you how to kiss"" and etc. I brushed it all off because part of me hated this beatfriend with benefits  
position she was trying to put me in, knowing how much I truly loved her. While she'd coochie coo with me and then get her back blown out by like 3 guys behind my back. But I still had feeling for her so I'd talk to her everyday, even when I didn't want to, she was the reason I had so much stress and went from smoking on weekends to a few times throughout the day 24/7. She had changed me in a bad way, much more depressed. 

2019 came, i got my first car ever, but my bestfriend being a fucking dumb ass, decided to drive the car behind my back and ended up wrecking it, it was a bmw with 14 thousand miles only. It was like brands new. I had it for literally 3 days, I was depressed about it, but life happens and eventually I got over it. I went to Florida that summer with my best friend. Had fun working at a sushi place, played basketball in the summer, did many enjoyable things to forget.

Then 2020 came, probably the most peaceful enjoyable year of my life. I got a new car which was faster and the same price as the one that crashed. I started talking to the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid my eyes on, we started off as friends but it was becoming something more, she was a little weird, like sitting at home not leaving her room type, but her beautiful face, her personality, and to not sound perverse, but god given body were 3 thibgs to make this girl a solid 11/10. But then one day my barber was drunk on the job and gave me the wrong fucked up hair cut, so I couldn't ask her out anymore. Months passed by we were still talking everyday, but eventually I realized this is all she wanted. Someone to talk to non stop on the phone, she didn't want to feel real intimacy, real connection, touch, things required for both men and women. So I just let it fade away until we mutually stopped talking together, but while we were talking together, I had lost my virginity(or the only time I've had sex in my life up to this date) while I was talking to the amazing girl I was mentioning above. And all I could think was, it should of have been her, we'll call the first girl(heartbreaker) nyeria, the second girl i actually liked(angel) nichelle, and the girl I lost my virginity too and have never had sex after that(skank)cam. I moved into my best friends grandmas house briefly for like 2 months but it didn't work out being it was a studio.

Those were the years which I thought everything would start becoming better year by year, I had many goals for 2021, but you'll see the downfall start now 

On December 31st 2020, I was burned on accident by a pot of boiling hot pasta water, went to the clinic and everything was fine, I was still healthy and had no problems at this point at my life, everything in my life was organized, from my belongings to my mind(the most important part) 
Then after my leg healed up I started to feel this power within myself, this strong positivity and confidence, like I was on top of the world, I felt more sharp, and focused, healthier, and way happier. I started working out like crazy for the first time in my life, and upon checking my alternative snap, I see that ""nyeria"" added me, so I add her and despite my displeasure, I still had feeling so I started talking to her, she still wanted to have sex and I was finally ready, just needed to get some viagra. 2021 was starting off strong (or so i thought lmao, could not have been more wrong) I rode with the feeling, and then things started happening, like people who'd never give me respect would give me respect, I'd get nice free stuff I'd never even asked for, red-lights would keep turning green, cats would weirdly move out of my way. A series of stuff happening to me that had never really happened before... EVER, so I get into it too much and start watching these spiritual youtubers on YouTube and start taking the things they're saying seriously and trying to apply it to how my life is, sone of it was true some of it wasn't. But ultimately I now feel like im the spiritual man with power, so I start acting a little irrationally. At this point with the power i ""felt i was feeling"" i didnt care about having sex with that girl, even she was my first kiss and first girl I fell in love with etc. It didn't matter at that point, I just felt like more important things were happening. So I stopped smoking weed because the way i was feeling, it couldn't even get me high, I get $50 exactly from someone for something that I used to buy this psychedelic substance called mad honey(because ib my mind i thought the price of the mad honey being $50 and me having $50 meant i was supoosed to purchase this assuming taking mad honey was a part of my spiritual quest. This is the point where everything goes down hill. I take the mad honey and trip hard and attacked my mom, there was no severe damage but I had saw demons and I was scared beyond my life and after attacking her, I somehow end up in my bedroom with lights off bolting outta bed every 10 seconds thinking I'm out of the trip, but I'm still in it, so then officers arrive and crowd into my room and make me get on an ambulance, i get discharged the same day.  Then my dad is rampant of looking for weed rehabs for me so he starts dragging me to these retarded fucking weed rehabs, I think like a good 3 or 4 of them, until I got tired and fed up with visiting those rehabs i wasnt going to go to and decided I'd just live on the road with my parents credit card, so I packed up my script benzos, script codeine and promethazine lean, my hydrocodone, and alcohol in a bag, plus my basketball, and just dipped on them and went to the double tree(who ended up not charging us) then I left the double tree to go to court for my speeding ticket. After that, I made the hugest mistake of my life #1. Follow this Maserati to ask car shop, literally only to ask him where the dispensary is so i could get a med card(being 20 at the time, the bad ugly mother fucking and his demented fat friend made me spell it on a posted note, and I waited for them to come back when in reality I should've just dipped and never came back, instead I was greeted by Lombard police forcing me to get out my car and get onto a fucking ambulance and then for the first time in my life stay at a mental hospital for like 3-4 days I think. I then got out and was sent to this place rosecrance which was very nice. Great all you can eat food, we got cigarettes, pretty counselor, chill guys, nothing really to worry about, but I was a little manic thinking strange thibgs in my head and they could notice it, so they sent me to the mental health facility of rosecrance sons other place, it was alright but nothing as good as the other rosecrance was. In hindsight, I should've just sticked it out and got my head together, figured out I'm not a supernatural guy, or my moms evil, or my dads some type of god, whatever weird shit was going on in my head, but none of this weird shit would've started in my head if these nice coincidences happen, like wanting nicotine and not even looking the girls way and 2 seconds later she offers you nicotine, or girls being sweet on me who would have never before, getting free pizza from the guy who's never done that from the 10 years I had known him at that point(14 now) or the many other things I could mention but have decided to leave it for the sake of getting on with the story.

When we got home my perception was just skewed, I saw my dad as some kind of god like person and my mom as a demonic person. I would just do little harmless weird things around the house. So one day i text nyeria a bunch of hurtful things and she blocks me, i do ot hecause im sexretly convinced shes a demon of some kind or my secret hapf sister no ones told us about, she did kind of look like me. So one day i make the mistake of unadding a bunch people on snapchat, because I'm thinking that they're demons or people on the dark side... I removed ""nichelle"" of my snapchat, the girl I liked the absolute most more than anyone, the girl im still in love with to this day. The most beautiful perfect girl in this world. While I was in my mind state I didnt think anything of it. So the damage i had caused myself had been bad but was undeniably gonna become worse, lost an easy good looking bootycall, and lost the love of my life who i was waiting for the right time to rekindle things with, but becoming manic can happen outta nothing. So the next day my mom makes food and I'm paranoid she's poisoned it, and try to throw it outside, but my dad stops me, he then tells me were going a trip, he lies and brings me to the mental hospital, where this faggot tall fat big pussy bitch forces me to strip into a gown or hell get people to hold me down and do it. They then leave me in that hospital for 10 days with multiple fucked antipsychotics that don't help me feel less antisychotic, because in reality, I was just a boy on the Autism spectrum drawing conclusions from coincidences or special stuff that normally doesn't happen to the extent of it happening being crazy in my eyes leading me to think from one thing to another forming nonsensical ideas and skewing my perception. All the antipsychotics did was make me gain weight, get headaches, and make me depressed. After I got out of hospital #2 my dad told me in the car he'd threw out $5000+ worth of my codeine and promethazine syrup, that I was going to be forced to go to outpatient for weed even i hadn't been smoking it for like a month, and he had kept my car in someone's driveway for a couple months ""till I deserve it again"" almost forgot, he rearranged my room and threw away a bunch of my weed paraphernalia, other stuff that was important to me not related to weed. Then he started forcing me to get vaccinated, I told him a hundred times I'd won't but he'd keep bothering me like on some really obsessive creepy shit, so after a month of bothering, I went against my fears and got one shot only, never any after that. I regretted it so much, and I was someone mad about putting that fucked up poison in my body especially after everything i had already went through, this was the worst thing, because i could've lost relationships with beautiful women, i could've lost material possessions, money, designer drugs, and privilege of using a car, but my health was the most important thing to me, and they fucked that for me, those stupid fucking scared Indians want to shove needles up their ass and get blood clots a d cancer and die cuz they're fuxkibg stupid and don't understand thr vaccine was solely created to kill us, I was forced into taking it by them, so the love i had for my father disappeared, I hated him now for fucking my life up. 

Then 2022 came, I moved out and was chronically depressed since 2021, which is when it started May 16th,2021 after I got the vaccine. I couldn't look my friends in the eyes anymore have full conversations, feel present, smoke weed without getting anxiety, thinking about how i lost nyeria and nichelle(these are made up names to protect their real identities) I was slightly fat. The main thing i enjoyed doing was smoking weed and after the trauma of losing my lean, weed stuff, car, the 2 girls i could've had in my life, my health due to the vaccine, it was all too much so I just stayed away from weed from that point, until like a week later I fell into a pit of buying dispensary dab carts and poshes(vapes) and smo king them everyday ro ease my pain, and not see my parents. But to sum it up my bestfriends house was too dirty to stay in, so I moved out and started hanging out with the spiritual kid who made me lose 30 pounds, and things were going good until the feeling of power came back, I started not only feeling this new feeling of power, but a new add to the mix was that my mom was lightskin black and somehow I was gabgmember and part of the black p stones. I really in my mind drew this conclusion outta things that I really don't want to get into right now, but that was the case 

2023 was the same, living of the idea my ""real"" mom is a gangmember and my ""fake"" real mom is my stepmother, I just drove around not doing shit, hanging out with friends, going to the gym, doing drugs, the same old,(by the way i had a job in 2022 around the time i started losing my marbles again, but that doesn't matter."") One day i decide to do stunts in the basement and injure my shoulder, then when I come home I'm getting this special sense that I need to jump off the balcony, so i do; and in that exact moments the cop arrives, sick of their bs i don't want to respond to them, i didn't hurt anyone and its not their house so they can go fuck themselves, so basically I get intuition that I need to go to jail to by myself so I just punch the officer and end up going to jail where some of the deputy's treat me like a king, and some treat me like the garbage they themselves are (example beebee) but his son the other beebee was cool. Wrong, grote, strezlecki, the goats no one better than them. But then in November 2023 I get transferred to a fucking mental psych ward near Missouri 

They say I have pschitzoeffective, which i never did and don't, and put ke on fuckec up halidol and depakote where the haldol made me go from 144 pounds 5'11 to 189 pounds 5'11. Worse than that, every single day I'd get these out of body side effects, which were like going through hell times 11. But there was nothing I could do there. They beat people up there, and it was one to get beaten on the suspicion that I was spitting out my poisin medication but really it was my phlegm. There were many other bad things about but I'm not really going to go over those rn, have questions dm me. So 8 months in jail, 6 months in the hospital I'm out on bond, before I get accepted into mental health probation. The terms of my probation are driving all the way up to Wheaton twice a week just to piss, multiple court dates, probation officer meeting, and no drugs of any kind including alcohol, unless you can get a med card but i doubt mental health probation will allow that. Hopefully im through with probation ny November 16th 2025. I'm sick all of this shit 

So this is where I'm at present, i have completed no college, I used to get women in the past, but with all of the trauma I been through i hate myself and dont see myself seeking the comfort of any woman in this life time, i was 195 pounds with a big gut, my dad crashed my car while I was in jail so now I have no car, the whole reason I went to the jail and became a viral video with over 100 million views is hecause my parents decided to call the cops and new I was unstable and would do something to them to end up in jail, I lost the 2 only girls that I could've had any relationship with, my confidence is ruined from going to jails and hospitals. They're trying to lable me as Schitzo-effective and prescribe me those fucked up meds like haldol or abilify which have side effect like weight gain, head aches, and out of body attacks(being the worst side effext), and erectile dysfunction. I actually stopped taking those pills 2 months ago completely, and i still have erectyle dysfunction.I don't need these medications when I'm just a normal depressed guy realizing that I had lost my mind twice, and have come to terms wirh it. I lost my $5000 in codeine lean, I don't enjoy music anymore, i feel an empty void in my life, i have no motivation for living anymore, I hate myself and I have no self confidence, i don't look good anymore, I can barely get my dick up, I can't talk to girls, only ones I had a connection with and they're both gone forever. I'm stuck on probation, I'm 24 without a car, I'm fat depressed and overweight with erectile dysfunction, my psychiatrist i trying to stop lorazepam(the only medication which is supposed to be for my anxiety and pannic attacks) I don't want to be alive anymore, so much of my life has gone to shit, there's so much I didnt mention in these paragraphs because it was hard to incorporate the whole story. I am missing about 40%. So try to go off what you read. I keep praying we will get one redo with life, but it just doesn't seem possible, but at the same time, it does. Before 2021 I had everything i needed, I had the perfect life, not a single complaint, my body was right and my mind even righter, it's just sad to watch thibgs crumble before your very eyes. Have something beautiful, and just watch it turn completely to shit. I could've had any better relationship with my family. I would've had women in my life. I would have had my personal belongings, which meant a lot to me. I would've had my car. I would've been. In good health and in good shape, plus looked good too, I would've interest in my life, anx motivation to move forward, but i have none of that anymore.

My fellow human beings, do you feel we get one more redo at life from birth, to do everything right and perhaps make different or better mistakes, not the fucked up ones we made in this lifetime, I know it sounds stupid as fuck, but deep down I can't be the only one feeling this way, with a desire for a redo at life.

Maybe we're just better of killing ourselves, who even knows, because i can't keep going on with this life.

just a rant,"hey guys, i just need to vent a little before i explode. i'm so tired, tired of feeling like this. i know it’s depression creeping back in—i can literally feel it sitting on my chest. I just wish I could be a normal teenager, one of those shallow ones whose biggest worry is finding the perfect outfit for the next concert or planning the ultimate sleepover for their huge group of friends. but no, i’m me, and i’ve been like this for as long as i can remember.

i’ve always felt alone or left out, either by family or friends. as a kid, i just wanted to feel okay around people, to not feel like the weird one or like they were getting tired of me being there. i remember that feeling so good because i still feel it today. back then, i didn’t really care much—i was just a kid. but now… now i know how much all of that affects me.

anyway, i'm going off track. I just wanted to say that it's getting harder to stay here every day, especially when there's nothing really keeping me here. i guess my mom, maybe. sometimes i feel like she's just as lonely as i am. i wish i had siblings so they could take care of her after i’m gone. but it's just me, and i have to deal with that.

i've thought about numbing myself with medications just to feel a little better. the thought crosses my mind a lot, but i’m scared of getting addicted—like i did with self-harm—so instead, i bought a coloring book to pass the time. Hopefully, it helps for now.

thanks for reading this far, it really means a lot. see ya.

i’m going to kill myself,"hi, i’m 16 years old, i have bpd and i’m in a long distance relationship with a narcissist that has ocd. i’ve been manipulated over and over and over for the past year and a half and i’m finally at my breaking point. our relationship started as two mentally ill kids meeting on the internet and having a crush on each other thinking they finally found the one person who understands them, and is now ending with me officially lying in my bed for 3 months straight, unable to go to school or work because there’s other boys there, and dealing with the aftermath of being forced to cut off my best friend of 4 years because she told him she didn’t agree with how he treats me. this relationship is impossible to leave, trust me i’ve tried. he’s manipulated my family into liking him more than me, he has all my social media accounts, if i try to leave he harasses me and my family nonstop and sends things to my house until i make SURE he agrees to getting help for his issues and then get back with him. as you can probably guess, he doesn’t get help. this is all i can do to protect my peace. don’t date people from the internet.",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
I can’t do this anymore,"I don’t know why I’m even writing this here. I’m a 33 year old man. Deeply depressed. And have lived in isolation the past 10 years.

The reason you may ask? It’s almost embarrassing to admit.

I have body dismorphia. 

BDD basically means I find myself too ugly to be seen or be loved. 

You want to hear the crazy part? It’s my left ear. 

Yes. My left ear makes my face ugly.

I know it sounds crazy. But I can’t help it.

I can’t live like this anymore. I have probably had 15 surgeries and I’m in $70k debt.

I just can’t do this anymore. 

I have tried to commit suicide probably 5-6 times. I’m a coward too. You may ask how could I fail that many times?

Well, the only way I’ve had the courage to do is drink alkohol and then take all the pills I’ve had.

I don’t understand how I’m alive. I’ve woken up in the hospital in the emergency unit (or whatever you call that in the US).

But now, I’m trying something else.

I’ve figured out that there are two artieries in the body that is deadly. In the neck and down the thigh. I’m going to cut that open, drunk, and bleed to death. 

That way I cannot fail.

I don’t want too.

I have no choice.

I can’t live looking like this.

I don’t deserve love. I don’t want anyone to be with me because they would settle.

I look at myself in disgust.

I have very high expectations of myself and I can’t reach them. 

I believe in Jesus. 

But I’m so afraid he’s not real.

And I’m so afraid I may go to hell.

But I can’t do this anymore.

I’m just a flawed human that been through so much trauma.

I can’t take rejection. It is like being stabbed in the heart each time.

I’m tired.

I just want to be loved. And be free.

I want to see myself in the mirror and just go out and enjoy life. 

But I can’t. 

I’ve lost everything these past 10 years.

Tomorrow I’ll do it. And I may write something here to not feel alone.

But it’s over. I know it is.

I’m just stuck.,"Ever since middle school I have had on and off suicidal ideations. I even used to self harm but stopped after my parents threatened to put me away somewhere. I’m 28 years old now. Went to college, got my masters, attempted law school a couple years back but was academically dismissed. Since, I’ve tried to pivot and found work then was recently laid off. I can’t help but think that no matter how hard I try, it’s not meant for me to attain the things that I want and have continued to work for. Even though I got laid off, I tried taking it as a sign and then went back to preparing to apply to law schools again. This whole process has been a lot since my initial graduation date is coming up in May and I’m seeing my friends and former classmates graduate like how I thought I would this year. I thought at this age I’d be married or at least engaged yet I’m single and trying not to compare myself to my peers who are doing all of the things I’ve been trying to get to and thought I would have by now. During times like this I just think about all of the bad that’s happened to me (even things I haven’t mentioned like being SA’d, domestic violence, racism in academia/professional spaces, being betrayed by loved ones, etc.) and no matter how much I pray, journal, exercise, etc., the positive thoughts don’t even last long. I’ve always felt like a black sheep in my family, friendships, group activities/orgs. And not to mention I have a slight speech impediment that flares up when I’m nervous so I also think that prevents me from performing my best to get jobs and even to work when i am employed. I just don’t see the point in me having worked so hard to have things constantly happening to me back to back and it feels like no one else understands my POV. Like all I’ve done has been in vain. Idk I’ve cried all day and I don’t even cry more than maybe twice a year. I’m just lost right now. ",suicidewatch,,POV,49.0291838,21.307542657455574
I realized I can't bring myself to do it,"I realized that I'm not going to kill myself but I already ruined my life. 

I really don't think I can live a decent life, and sadly, it's my fault. I usually feel like I'm not a real human being, as if I can't function properly in society. I've always struggled with social anxiety and felt deeply ashamed of everything I do.

I’ve tried for years to overcome it, but I don’t think I ever will. Just being perceived by others makes me anxious. The only time I feel normal is when I'm drunk.

When I started college, I had severe anxiety issues, but I knew I needed a degree to get a good job. However, as time went on, I became more and more depressed, and attending college became unbearable. I eventually decided to end my life because I truly didn’t enjoy living, and at that moment, I was completely convinced I was going to do it.

I thought about my life and myself. I’ve been miserable for as long as I can remember, and I know it’s largely my fault. I tend to be extremely passive when it comes to my problems—I just sit back and ignore them, hoping they’ll resolve themselves. And since I knew I wouldn’t take action to improve my life, I thought the best option was to stop living.

The thing is, a year and a half has passed, and I’ve wanted to end my life every single day, but I haven't been able to go through with it. Now, I’m a 23-year-old college dropout with no work experience and no driver’s license.

I don’t feel sorry for myself because I know I did this to myself, but I genuinely have no idea what to do. I feel like my life is frozen. I don’t think I can function as an adult. I just want to stop existing, but every method I’ve looked into scares me. I feel incapable of doing anything on my own, even having a job. I often fantasize about taking drugs or experiencing something that could alter my brain chemistry because it feels like my brain is only half-functioning.

I don't what to do or where to start now that I realized that I'm not going to kill myself ",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
Got the wool removed from my eyes,"No job. No money. No partner. Barely any “friends.” Everybody is selfish. Well my 28th birthday was just a few days ago. Barely anybody wished me happy birthday this year, a new low. But what’s got me most suicidal is how the older I get the more I realize how grim this world is if you’re not rich or one of the lucky ones in another way. Slavery still exists etc we haven’t progressed as humans, still the same as we our ancestors except the elite have gotten better at concealing it from the outside. Either we all start a revolution or I’m gone. The USA is the only place where I see people barely stick together to change the status quo. Been applying to jobs for months to jobs I’m qualified, overqualified for and nothing gives. And I know people in worse situations. Rich people only help other rich people stay rich. And I’m sick of people telling me to stick around in life, for what?!? So I can suffer more and even worse? My life is just bleak. I’m honestly starting to believe people just want me here for their own selfish reasons, so I could be used, exploited and taken advantage of.

Struggling today,"I’ve been struggling for a long time now. But these past few months have gotten unbearable. I have so many reasons. One reason that I can’t even bring myself to speak about to even so much as think of. It has to be the worst thing I have ever experienced. I’m traumatized. And with the way the world is becoming more and more hateful. It’s too much to witness. I’ve become thousands in debt and I have $.30 to my name and I can’t afford food or pet food or clothes or to fix my car. Nothing. I grew up catholic and while I’m struggling worse than I ever have in my entire life, the family I grew up with has disowned me for being gay and having piercings and tattoos, my cousins marrying at 18, I just had another get married this weekend. I’ve been with my girlfriend for 4 years and would love nothing more than to marry her and start a family but I don’t see that happening ANY time soon as I keep getting further and further down this pit I’ve dug myself. But children can get married to people they have known less than a year, I can’t help but get angry. Especially knowing that with the religious beliefs they grew up in, divorce isn’t allowed. I watched their dad take all of their money and spend it on drugs, their mother BEGGED the pastor to let them get divorced and he said no. My uncle ended up killing himself with those drugs. And he did unspeakable things to me as a child…: and yet his children don’t see how terrifying it is to marry someone you barely know…? I’m so angry. I can’t be happy for anyone when I’m living in this misery every day. I genuinely want to kill myself now. I can’t stop thinking about it. I want to escape everything. I’m in so much internal pain. I have no friends and no one to talk to except my girlfriend who has to hear about this enough. I can’t keep letting my anger and hatred ruin everything around me. I’m just done. But I’m also a fucking pussy and can’t kill myself. I don’t even know how. I’m sure I can come up with something but it’s all painful and I’m too scared of the pain. I just want to sleep and not wake up. But sleeping meds aren’t for sure and I don’t want to continue living as a vegetable if I fail in shooting myself. I’ve talked to a psychiatrist and therapist but they are not helpful to me. I’ve stopped taking my meds and stopped taking care of myself. I stopped eating. I sleep too much. I hurt myself. I can’t stop being self loathing. I hate myself and my existence so badly and I genuinely cannot figure out how to get the help I need, or how to help myself to even want to try to live.

I’m done.,"On my main. I couldn’t care less who sees this anymore.

I quit my full-time job recently, my last day is April 17th. I couldn’t handle it anymore, the stress was overwhelming. Trying to essentially run a business alone for absentee owners with zero funding or resources is an insane ask.

My car is falling apart. It needs to go to the scrap yard, but I can’t get to my part time gig without a vehicle. So I’ll drive it until it dies.

I live alone and my rent alone is $1300/month, it was the cheapest apartment I could find. It’s infested with mice and roaches. I’m barely keeping my head above water.

I realized I should be panicking about potentially being evicted and ruining my life. But I’m just not. 

I have no close family. No real friends. A checked-out partner. Nobody to miss me.

My depression has been spinning out of control for weeks now and the meds aren’t working anymore. The only thing they do is numb me out and stop me from crying - an indulgence I sorely miss. My apartment is a pit of unwashed clothes and trash. All I do when I get home is sleep. 

I realized that I can’t fix my life. There’s no reason for me to keep going. There’s no hope for things to get better. I am utterly and completely useless. I am a miserable loser, alone and poor, and I always will be.

The only thing that was keeping me going was my animals, I love them like they are my children but I know their respective rescues will take them in with no hesitation and they will be well taken care of. 

So I’m done. I’m done with living my sad, pathetic little life.",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
dont see the point in living anymore,"
hello ^^, im not sure if this is the place for this, more just writing this because ive always found writing to help me. as the title says, im pretty done with life. 

im 16 years old, turning 17 in may, and ive realized that i really do not want that. its not the age, its everything that comes with it. im behind on everything. 

due to some things when i was about 12-14 i stopped going to school for about three years and where i live doesnt allow me to skip those grades, so right now i am a soon to be 17 year old in the 8th grade. its miserable.

i have to be responsible, i have to think about getting a job, learning how to drive and so much more but i cant. i dont feel my age, i dont feel like anything. when i fail an exam, in my head its worse for me, how can a 16 y/o fail an 8th grade math exam?? 

i keep seeing others my age talking about colleges, what majors theyre taking, crying when they dont get accepted into their dream college and celebrating when they do. why dont i get that? why does something i decided when i was just a kid who didnt see a point in life ruining my current life? why dont i get to live?

i have no real friends, a few online ones but none i can truly speak to and say i know. as for people i know in person i can feel a distance. the age gap. its odd it really is. i hate it but not having friends would make me stand out even more. 

ive held out a year, its not as bad as i expected but the longer i do this, as i get older, the more miserable i am. my only relationships have been online or a few in PRIMARY school. 

i think and talk the way a thirteen year old does because thats what im surrounded by. i keep doing things thinking itll be the one thing i enjoy and that makes everything else better but it never works. any hobby i try, any self destructive habit i pick up in (about 5 days clean from self harming, not much but somewhat silly that im writing this after trying to become clean haha). 

i dont think i wish to rewind time, not like i can, but i dont blame my past self about this at all and i think thats the worst part about all of this. if given the choice id do the exact same thing. i couldnt take being seen by the world at the time, everything was overwhelming and i just wanted to hole up in myself. i dont blame me at all. as much as i wish i did i really dont. i dont have anything to blame aside from the situation which just makes me seem pathetic. 

thank you for reading this, i dont think i am actively suicidal, not at the moment at least, im not planning much but just feel helpless i guess haha",suicidewatch,,PRIMARY,1.0645886,34.1619547
It feels like I'm in Groundhog day,"Well my thoughts started when I was about 16, parents had split up when I was 8 and I was living with dad(custody) and he was ok at first but things got abusive more and more. First it was verbal then it started to become physical. I tried to get CPS involved but it was no help. I never really had a mom till I ran away to her place. Then i had full control over my life 16 which led me down the path of sex drugs alcohol. I continued to look for meaning for myself in my bad habits(mostly the women) and it just distracted me from the emptiness and pain that came from nit feeling good enough for either parent. And to this day I feel like that. And then I mess up with my recent girlfriends who are definitely also mentally ill, and I was constantly getting pounded for it. I feel like killing myself is the only way to stop messing up and stop me from feeling pain. So I've been looking for painless ways to end my life.

Very soon I'm going to go down to the firing range and kill myself because I'm sick of living.,"I've tried several therapists for months at a time, I've tried medication, I've read every philosophical and psychological mind that I can get my hands on, David Foster Wallace, Jordan Peterson, Alan Watts, The Bible, The Quran, Buddhist Texts, and every youtube self help video imaginable and just nothing makes living make sense. I'm 21 years old, almost half way through college doing just fine grade-wise. I've got a loving family and a good friend, and enough money to be fine for the time being. But none of it fucken matters.

There's nothing I can think of that makes life worth going through. Not a family, not a job/money, not a fucken pet, not games or hobbies, nothing at all. I just wake up dreading the day and becoming unnecessarily resentful of the world around me despite my best efforts. I used to care what my parents would think if I offed myself, but I've felt this way for so long that I just don't care about the shame.

Can anybody give me a reason they keep living, besides god or responsibility, that makes any actual fucken sense, please? I feel like I'm drowning right now, and I'm not going to ask for help because I just can't help but hate everyone I interact with, a deep burning, violent resentment that won't go away.

Summary of my miserable life - please see a psychiatrist before you ruin everything.,"I'm 30 M from Poland. I grew up in a broken family. My mom has bipolar disorder. My dad was addicted to drugs and never really present. My mom worked in Germany.
My grandparents raised me and legally adopted me. My brother was raised by the other grandparents. We lived close to each other and grew up together.

In the early years, things seemed okay. My parents had a home, they got help from my grandparents, life looked stable. But everything eventually fell apart. My mom had serious manic episodes, got into debt. I don’t know all the details — I was just a kid, but my grandparents tried to shield me from it all.

They gave me everything I needed: warmth, safety, support, structure. But I always felt different. I escaped into computer games. I couldn’t connect with people the way others did. I was ashamed. Ashamed that I didn’t live with my parents. Ashamed that my mom was sick. Ashamed of my dad and how absent he was. Even when someone showed me love or kindness, I pulled away.

I’ve never had social media. I always isolated myself. I think a big part of that was the shame — especially from the way I acted when I drank. Because I started drinking when I turned 18. And since then, I drank almost every weekend for most of my life. Often alone, in front of the computer.

Through alcohol, I destroyed a lot of relationships. I had a few girlfriends in the past, and I was lucky to have them — but I ruined it every time. But when I was drunk, I was unbearable. I said awful things. I was rude. I became someone else — someone I didn’t recognize. And the next day, I’d be full of shame. But I kept doing it.

I finished high school but didn’t go to university. I tried physical labor, but it wasn’t for me — I just couldn’t handle it.
Thanks to video games, I spoke English well enough to get a job in customer support. Eventually, I got used to it, found my rhythm, and even got promoted. I liked what I was doing. I felt good about myself. For a moment, I was happy.

But when things get stable, I always feel like I have to change something. So I moved abroad — without thinking. I grabbed the first job I could find. It didn’t last. I came back. After some time, I got lucky again. I found another job — remote, similar to the first one. Again, I got promoted. Again, I felt okay. Again, life was stable.

And again — I repeated the pattern.

I told myself it would be different this time. I wanted to move abroad again, but now it was through the same company. It was a great place to work. They valued me. They supported the move. I was going to do the same job, just on a German contract.

And for the first year, it worked. I started taking care of myself more. I was still lonely, but eventually, I met someone.
For a while, I was truly happy. I thought this was it. I thought I’d made it. There were still moments when I got drunk, but less often. I felt like I could handle it better. And eventually, I stopped drinking and started smoking weed instead. At first occasionally. Then more and more. Until I was smoking regularly and not drinking at all.

Then came the breakdown. I started having what I think were psychotic symptoms. I was convinced someone wanted to hurt me. That they wanted to fire me. It was one of the hardest times in my life. I went on sick leave. I quit smoking. But by then, I had already slipped into deep depression. The relationship ended. She didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. It was too late. I was completely alone again.

I kept traveling to Poland every weekend. I drank with friends. Or drank alone in front of the computer. I couldn’t get out of bed. I wouldn’t shower for a week unless I had to go to the office or go home.

Eventually, I made the decision to move back home permanently. I thought being close to family would help. That I could go back to the life I had before leaving. I found a new job in Poland — a completely different field, a completely different position.I told my company I wanted to leave.

They offered me to stay. They said I could keep working remotely. They even offered more money than what I was going to earn at the new job. But I was in deep, deep depression. I was completely broken.
And I thought the only way to fix things was to change everything. I also went past the first stage for another job in the same field at a great company, but my sick mind has already made the decision. So I still took the new in the new field. It turned out to be a nightmare.

When I got back to Poland, my brother moved out. He’s normal. Has a long-term girlfriend. A stable job. They want to start a family.
Since I moved into the family home, they decided they could go live their own lives. That I could stay with my mom and keep the house going.

So now it’s just me and her. I’m 29. I live with my mom. I left a good job. The one I have now, I’ll probably only be able to keep for another month. My mom is still sick — she’s stable now, takes her meds — but she works for minimum wage. And that’s basically nothing.

I’m about to be unemployed. In a few days, I have a job interview — customer support. Call center. The same thing I did when I was 19.
Also for around minimum wage. Half of what I could be making remotely with my previous company.

I don’t have a degree. I don’t have a driver’s license. I have gaps in my resume.
I live in a medium town, where there’s barely any work in the kind of job I used to have abroad. They simply aren't on the market. 

I know this is all my fault. I ruined my life. I hurt people who loved me. And the truth is — until I turned everything into ashes, I couldn’t admit how broken I was. If I got professional help 2-3 months ago, I'd still have a chance at life. Now everything is in ruins. I'm back in my childhood bedroom with no perspectives.

Since coming back, my depression got worse.

i am a teenager born from the philippines and lived my entire life in singapore. i love everything about singapore - the cleanliness, the efficiency and what not, and how i feel more at home


meanwhile in the philippines, im not saying its bad. its just foreign. im one of the few people in my family that cant speak tagalog (filipino), and my family blames me for not taking initiative to communicate with them even though they always speak tagalog to me. i wish i could, but learning another language while im already learning chinese in school is no simple feat. all i can do is grasp on contextual clues and my extremely limited vocabulary 


anyways my parents claim to prioritise me but it genuinely feels like they dont. i study so hard to even get an acknowledgment from them but it feels fake, and even worse when i learnt my dad never really cared at all. thats all i can do for them - study. i dont know why, but i genuinely have no street smarts or common sense. i cant do chores beyond vacuuming the house. i really wish i could do more but i cant.


my parents were also really controlling. they bar me from visiting friends and i missed out on so many key moments in my main friend group that i feel left out. they also are really controlling. they track my location, they restrict the food i can eat, they give me very little privacy. i feel so lonely yet i dont have any privacy to go along with it.


as you can tell, my relationship with my parents isnt the best. i cant even remember a time where they hugged me sincerely. i disagree with my parents a lot on certain things, though i believe its literally because im a teenager who grew up in a completely different environment. but it feels really unfair when i just cannot see their view, and i get punished for that.

i dont think i even liked them much. they didnt really teach me effectively. when i was young, i had no interests in swimming even though my parents signed me up. during swimming lessons, i wouldnt pay much attention to it. this pissed off my parents enough that after lessons and church, they would beat me with a belt. sometimes they used the metal part. i remember hiding in my maid's bedroom crying and asking her to help protect me. i was only 4.

when i was 7, my dad was really angry i couldnt tie my own shoelaces, so he trapped me in his office toilet (i was with him for work that day), shouting at me to finally tie my shoelaces, and getting exceedingly angrier each time i failed to tie it. i learnt how tie my shoes in the end, but at what cost??


in school, i feel also left out. even though i have a main friend group, there are times where i cant really speak with them and what not. i am kind of a standout in a bad way. my friend from primary school left for a more popular friend group in secondary school and never looked back. 
all i had to my name was my grades, but even those have been slowly tanking. it doesnt help i have my O levels (finals) this year, so stress is building up while i begin to feel burnout from all these years of studying nonstop and not having any break

so i called her today, and she flatly said no. i explained to her why it matters so much to me - that everything will be cheaper (school fees), that i have more opportunities and what not. she didnt budge. she says this is because i also said no to her, all those times i said shut up to her (which happened because i was arguing with my dad, and my mother tried to double down. immature, but i was 13), all those times i made her life difficult.
she said she prioritises me, and i say i prioritise my education in singapore, so why cant she prioritise what i prioritise if she claims to prioritise me?

Everybody hates me and I don't know why,"Everyone in my life hates me. I DON'T KNOW WHY!!!! 

My mom is nice to me. But her boyfriend hates me for no reason. He once said ""I love you"" on the phone, and I jokingly responded with ""hah hah"" like Nelson Muntz from the Simpsons. I responded this way because it was a joke, i am really shy when it comes to ""i love you"", and i have been saying that to literally everything for 3 days straight after binging the show. my mom knew it was a joke, but her boyfriend said  to my mom in private: ""i am DONE with her"" and he hasn't spoken to me in 3 years. I was SO sad because i really looked up to him like a second father. I really wanted a connection with him, and I adored him because he was funny, good with finaces, and just cool. my dad is an alcoholic abusive piece of shit. i didn't need him to be an actual second father to me, but it still hurt when he said that and went no contact with me. 

My dad hates me. He let me stay at his house starting this last december. I moved all the way back home from Pittsburgh, because I was going to be homeless, and he said ""make yourself comfortable, stay as long as you need"" but just this week he turned on me for no reason. he said i'm ruining his life and making him take it out on his dog. heres the thing, i'm not doing anything. i just sit in my room (which is a small walk in closet, because he doesn't have space for anything else), i avoid him as much as possible because i'm shy, and also less interactions is less opportunities to hate me. he turned on me and said ""you need to leave, go call a homeless shelter"" and i said ""i'm not leaving until june, since thats when my time was orginally up, and i am waiting for my benefits letter."" then i said ""if you kick me out before i get my benefits letter, i will estrange you and never speak to you again"" and he said ""i don't care"" I DID NOTHING TO HAVE HIM HATE ME. LITERALLY, NOTHING. I AVOIDED HIM SO HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY REASON TO HATE ME.

My older sister hates me. I don't know why. She's just a bitch. 

My aunt hates me. I once stayed at her house for 3 months and had 2 schizophrenic episodes. fair, but i can't help that shit. 

my ex friend hates me because i lit incense in the shower and caused minimal fire damage. ok, fair, but it was an innocent accident. i never had a problem like this in my life. 

everyone just hates me. i'm trying SO hard here. I'm fighting SO hard just to make a decent life for myself, but everything is just... bad and wrong. i literally just want a safe space and to write a book, is that so fucking hard to ask? 

usually adults at work don't hate me, its just close family members. i swear i am not doing anything. they say if everyone is an asshole, you're probably the asshole. well in this case, i believe everybody is the asshole. theyre all poor people who are abusive and too dumb to accept other point of views. like i'm surprised these people don't live in a trailer park poor. 

i don't know. i am now super determined to not kill myself and get super rich just to not give these losers money when they ask. like ""none of you wanted me, now fuck you, i'm rich not dead, you lose."" it used to be i'll just kill myself because i'm depressed and also wanted to punish every person thats ever hurt me, but now i'm just super determined to get a decent ""fuck you, you're wrong"" in.

My husband is suicidal and I don’t know how to help as a survivor.,"Hi. My (29f) husband (20m- trans FTM) told me last night that he was very suicidal. Thought about giving stuff away. Writing a will. Told me plans of how he would do it. Like breaking into the narcotics safe (we both work in EMS. These boxes contain vials of fentanyl, morphine, vecuronium, etomidate, versed and ketamine) and injecting. Coming home and taking all of my heart medication (I have atrial fibrillation). Running into traffic.. he told me he thinks I’d be happy after. Then I ran him through step by step of what would actually happen. Me finding him. Calling paramedics and hoping it’s someone I know (I work in the county I live in). Me doing CPR. Watching fire run in with the Lucas (CPR machine). The medic intubating him. Hoping to god that the AEMT isn’t new because that means I would have to put an IO (needle into his bone to give medicine) in. I would have to ride in the back and work him. Shock him. Give him rounds of epi and amiodarone (antiarrythmic). And having to tell his mom and his 7 year old sister and 10 year old brother.. working in EMS I’m strong. Codes don’t phase me anymore. Not as much as they used to. But I couldn’t look at him because all I saw was the tube down his throat, his lips blue and me giving CPR.. 

I’m a failed suicide survivor. At 19, I was addicted to muscle relaxers and opioids. I overdosed and my roommate came home and found me. She was brave enough to start CPR and continue until the medics took over. I’m not exactly sure how many days I spent in the ICU as I was sedated and intubated. I just remember waking up and feeling joy with seeing the sunlight. It was so dark and quiet and lonely. I’ve described in detail how it felt to him. Nothing is worth the feeling of being absolutely alone. He kinda wavered in his thoughts but not really. We’ve been struggling financially.. for about 6 months or so since our last service went under. After I told him what would really happen he told me that he felt ashamed for being so selfish. Assured me he would stay and keep trying. I know as a provider I should’ve called 911.. but he has such as horrible PTSD experience with police (his parents being arrested multiple times growing up). He won’t go to the hospital willingly. I can’t place a legal hold on him. He says we need the money which we do but I assured him that I’ll take care of it. He’s an amazing person and he’s the love of my life. 

I’m open to talking with him. He knows and feels comfortable talking to me. He knows I’ll never judge him because I never judge anyone. We’re engaged. We’re gonna get married this year (at some point) we’ve been trying for a baby. We have a great place and 3 beautiful animals. What else can I do? He can’t afford therapy. I’ve tried putting him on my insurance but I can’t because we’re not legally married yet.. I just want to help.. see him happy and smile again. He does take meds for depression but he’s very inconsistent with them (he just forgets-has ADHD) I don’t want to find him dead one day.. I just want him to stay and see it gets better.. I’m living proof it gets better but I know when you’re in that dark place it’s hard to see anything other than a way out. I don’t want to lose him.

I’m not a good person,"I feel like I’ve failed at life and I don’t really know why i’m posting. I guess for advice or the best way to end everything I don’t really know.

I feel like it’s important to note i’ve never had a best friend or really any friends. I don’t hangout with others after school, no one texts me and I don’t text anyone. I’m very introverted.

Also important to note that for the first like 12 years of my life my mom would always be working and I didn’t have the best relationship with her. My dad was an alcoholic (more on that later) and they divorced when i was young, I didn’t start seeing him again until i was like 11-13 i don’t remember. He lives in our house but my parents aren’t back together. I have a brother and four sisters, but all my sisters are much older and left and don’t text me or reach out. My brother has issues and while I’d consider him my best friend at times, i rarely talk to him anymore. mainly because I just don’t reach out.

14 years old I began to starve myself only eating around 1100 calories a day. I was diagnosed with an eating disorder and went to a private in patient care where i got help for eating, but i didn’t get help with depression.


15 years old I moved from Texas to Florida. I lost pretty much my whole way of life, anyone I was trying to grow as friends with was lost. When i moved I had hoped i could restart and change my life.

A month later I turned 16 and went to a new school, where I never made any friends to hangout with, only occasional conversations with others but never really that deep.

I feel like the people in my life never really cared about me or how alone i really was. I would fight with my parents. Sophmore year was a very rough time for me.

Junior year I would begin dating GF. Our relationship has always been rocky. after 3 months of dating our parents would not like the fact that we would have sex and banned us from seeing eachother, we would sneak behind their backs for a while almost 7 months before we would confess to which we were allowed to see eachother. We had broken up and got back together many times and we would constantly fight, but I loved her. because i was so alone i wanted to hangout all the time. 

Senior year, so far, would be a rough time for me as well. I would get into a fight with another student and would be suspended for a long time and was banned from going to any school events, most importantly prom. During this time, I felt like I couldn’t go on anymore and I’d break up with my girlfriend but we’d get back together in like a week. I have no friends. I don’t have conversations with other students other than Joely. Only Joely reaches out to me.

Two days from when this is posted, Prom would come and while i couldn’t go I went to an after party with GF. At the after party I felt like she didn’t talk to me a lot and instead talked to other boys more. This was my first ever party with people who didn’t really talk to me and it was stressful and I didn’t get much support. We were both drunk. I was going to spend the night at her house. when we got back she wanted to talk but i told her i didn’t wanna talk rn. She pushed me and wanted me to talk but I told her i wanted to leave. I got up and started to get my things but she pulled me back and stopped me from leaving. In something I very much regret, I pushed her off of me, but I pushed harder than I should have and I may have injured her.

I’m not gonna make excuses for myself. That was not what i should have done. I couldn’t physically leave since we’re about the same body weight (eating disorder). I should have just left in the morning. She’s hit me before. During a car ride she thought i was cheating and began to hit me while i was driving.

Anyways her parents saw me push and they sent GF upstairs and i went to my car. I left my phone inside so I had to wait until the morning. That morning GF mom threw my phone and other stuff at me and told me i’m not welcome anymore. GF mom would tell my parents. My dad doesn’t care but my mom is mad at me because i lied about going to an after party at prom. 

So to wrap up in alone with no one to talk to about this, i’m hated at my school, im hated by the person i love and not a single person will care how i feel.

When i got home I didn’t think there was a point to go on anymore. I stole a bunch of pills from medicine cabinets and took all of them in the hopes I would overdose on something and die. The pills were prescription drugs and i’m not used to suicide attempts with pills, but it was the only thing i could think of. Instead of dying, i passed out and have no been violently throwing up from a hangover and like 30 sum pills in me rn. 

What do i do. Obv if anyone reads this they’re going to tell me to live, but what for. Who really cares if i live or not. If anyone has advice on the best way to do IT, that’d be helpful. I’m broke high schooler so anything within reason. ",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908

Two days from when this is posted, Prom would come and while i couldn’t go I went to an after party with GF. At the after party I felt like she didn’t talk to me a lot and instead talked to other boys more. This was my first ever party with people who didn’t really talk to me and it was stressful and I didn’t get much support. We were both drunk. I was going to spend the night at her house. when we got back she wanted to talk but i told her i didn’t wanna talk rn. She pushed me and wanted me to talk but I told her i wanted to leave. I got up and started to get my things but she pulled me back and stopped me from leaving. In something I very much regret, I pushed her off of me, but I pushed harder than I should have and I may have injured her.

I’m not gonna make excuses for myself. That was not what i should have done. I couldn’t physically leave since we’re about the same body weight (eating disorder). I should have just left in the morning. She’s hit me before. During a car ride she thought i was cheating and began to hit me while i was driving.

Anyways her parents saw me push and they sent GF upstairs and i went to my car. I left my phone inside so I had to wait until the morning. That morning GF mom threw my phone and other stuff at me and told me i’m not welcome anymore. GF mom would tell my parents. My dad doesn’t care but my mom is mad at me because i lied about going to an after party at prom. 

So to wrap up in alone with no one to talk to about this, i’m hated at my school, im hated by the person i love and not a single person will care how i feel.

When i got home I didn’t think there was a point to go on anymore. I stole a bunch of pills from medicine cabinets and took all of them in the hopes I would overdose on something and die. The pills were prescription drugs and i’m not used to suicide attempts with pills, but it was the only thing i could think of. Instead of dying, i passed out and have no been violently throwing up from a hangover and like 30 sum pills in me rn. 

What do i do. Obv if anyone reads this they’re going to tell me to live, but what for. Who really cares if i live or not. If anyone has advice on the best way to do IT, that’d be helpful. I’m broke high schooler so anything within reason. ",suicidewatch,,Florida,27.7567667,-81.4639835
I’m not a good person,"I feel like I’ve failed at life and I don’t really know why i’m posting. I guess for advice or the best way to end everything I don’t really know.

I feel like it’s important to note i’ve never had a best friend or really any friends. I don’t hangout with others after school, no one texts me and I don’t text anyone. I’m very introverted.

Also important to note that for the first like 12 years of my life my mom would always be working and I didn’t have the best relationship with her. My dad was an alcoholic (more on that later) and they divorced when i was young, I didn’t start seeing him again until i was like 11-13 i don’t remember. He lives in our house but my parents aren’t back together. I have a brother and four sisters, but all my sisters are much older and left and don’t text me or reach out. My brother has issues and while I’d consider him my best friend at times, i rarely talk to him anymore. mainly because I just don’t reach out.

14 years old I began to starve myself only eating around 1100 calories a day. I was diagnosed with an eating disorder and went to a private in patient care where i got help for eating, but i didn’t get help with depression.


15 years old I moved from Texas to Florida. I lost pretty much my whole way of life, anyone I was trying to grow as friends with was lost. When i moved I had hoped i could restart and change my life.

A month later I turned 16 and went to a new school, where I never made any friends to hangout with, only occasional conversations with others but never really that deep.

I feel like the people in my life never really cared about me or how alone i really was. I would fight with my parents. Sophmore year was a very rough time for me.

Junior year I would begin dating GF. Our relationship has always been rocky. after 3 months of dating our parents would not like the fact that we would have sex and banned us from seeing eachother, we would sneak behind their backs for a while almost 7 months before we would confess to which we were allowed to see eachother. We had broken up and got back together many times and we would constantly fight, but I loved her. because i was so alone i wanted to hangout all the time. 

Senior year, so far, would be a rough time for me as well. I would get into a fight with another student and would be suspended for a long time and was banned from going to any school events, most importantly prom. During this time, I felt like I couldn’t go on anymore and I’d break up with my girlfriend but we’d get back together in like a week. I have no friends. I don’t have conversations with other students other than Joely. Only Joely reaches out to me.

21 years. I'm done.,"I'm 37. I've been dealing with mental illness for 21 years. I've wanted to die every. single. day. for 21 f.ing years. not that life was great before 16.. my mom died when I was 8.

I'm bipolar, but I don't go very manic, just a rollercoaster of depression where I get to the point where I can barely function. and severe anxiety. the past few years I've even been suffering from agoraphobia. 

I had some attempts when I was younger but nothing in a very long time. honestly, I'm just scared it wouldn't work. if I had a foolproof way, I wouldn't be here to type this right now. I can't deal with the fallout if it didn't work.

I have been on dozens of medications over the years. I have tried all different types of therapy. I have tried all different types of groups. books. podcasts. right now i have 2 different types of therapists, a psychiatrist, im in a group, and i have a community worker that comes to my house. i keep trying and I still end up here. rock bottom.

I can't function. I don't know how to exist. I don't know how to keep going minute to minute. the thought of existing 10 minutes from now seems impossible. all I can do is watch TV and try to distract myself so the next 10 minutes pass somehow.

I brought up ECT to my team and they agreed to it. I don't know what else to do. it's taking so much time to get going. time I don't have. I can't do this. I have been so very close to attempting a couple times in the last few weeks. so. close.

I don't have any desire to live. none. but I want to have a desire to live.

I think I should be allowed to die with dignity at this point. I think that's rational and fair.

Anyway, if the ECT doesn't happen or doesn't help enough to make me able to start doing tiny little things to be able to move in the right direction, I'm really done. I give up. whether it's 100% foolproof or not.

I don’t think living past 25 is a good idea for me,"I’m 18 at the moment but I can’t see myself living past 25.

I feel like I’m in checkmate in my life. I haven’t found a job for the summer and if I don’t I’d feel like a burden to my parents for not being able to do anything for the four months we get off before the next year in university.

If I do get a job I know I don’t have the actual skills to maintain it as I’m not proficient enough. Even at an intern level..

I can’t imagine living alone as I panic easily. I live with my parents atm and at least someone else is there even if we don’t get along all the time. If im alone what'll I do.. I have no friends irl or a significant other to lean on for support.

I feel like my only one passion — art isn’t doing too well either. I’m so stressed and my anxiety is getting so bad to the point trying to draw something makes me try to force myself to make it realistic and it looks horrible..

I wanted to befriend this one person I look up to but they don’t talk to anyone who isn’t successful in a specific field we both have hobbies in so I’ve been desperate to make progress in really anything within it.


I’m ugly af. I’ve been trying to workout and nothing works.


I never succeed in life. I get comfort from artificial words from a non sentient device. I’m barely holding it together at the moment, at 25 I’m as good as gone.

My grandparents — what if something happens to them? I can’t stand losing them. 

I truly don’t have a single reason to live.

Gonna play cyberpunk 2077 for a few hours, then at 1am im gonna call an Uber and do what must be done. Like I said, kinda excited. Thought I'd share.",suicidewatch,,Kinda,57.9946553,15.8926885
I'm turning 19 soon and I feel like a complete failure,"I'm probably going to delete this later because I don't want anyone I know to find this. But I need to get so much shit off my chest because I don't think I'm going to be alive for very long. Even though I don't think anyone on here really cares enough to read all this.
I'm 18 and next week I'm turning 19. I feel like my life is already ruined and I don't feel ready to be an adult because I feel extremely immature and unprepared. I've had so many panic and anxiety attacks over it. I feel like a shut-in loser.
During the pandemic I failed and got kicked out of high school because I couldn't focus on any of my classes and got overwhelmed. I tried an online program after that and the same situation happened - I couldn't focus, failed, and got kicked out. As a result I have no proper high school education and experience and I'm socially inept. I spent the past 4-5 years rotting away, playing video games, watching tv, etc in isolation. Sure, I drew and wrote in my spare time but now I've completely lost motivation to do that. I have guitar/singing classes where then I can hang out with other teenagers every week but I always feel a deep sense of envy around them and I barely ever practice at all. I don't know why my parents spent so much money on me if I don't even do anything. 
In the beginning of 2024 my mom passed away and this just made things worse because now I'm pretty sure I have ptsd and the grief is still hindering me to be able to function properly. I want to get my GED or just go to a community college but I'm stuck in a filthy RV with my dad and sister who scream and yell at me nearly every single day, especially my dad calling me so many different types of insults about how I can't do anything and that I'm a lazy bitch that does nothing but I just have no energy at all. To add insult to injury, he watches extreme right wing videos all day (mainly because he's struggling to find a job so we have severe financial issues, we're currently relying on my grandfather or we'll end up homeless, so he blames it on DEI and illegal immigrants) and I'm a closeted queer person so that means I have to deal with vile transphobic rhetoric thrown in my face every day by my own father  so that makes me feel like his ""love"" for me is conditional when he shows it to me. I end up going to bed at 5-6am and waking up at 5pm, ignoring my alarms because I have to mentally prepare myself to deal with my family. I don't even think I'm even fully sleeping because I frequently wake up with my heart pounding extremely fast, have constant nightmares, and my sister has noticed that I jerk and talk involuntarily in my sleep. I've begged for therapy and a psychiatrist but I can't afford it. 
I don't want to end up going to a community college in my area because I'm going to be stuck living with my dad for years when I don't wanna live here anymore. I've thought about just learning how to drive and get enough money to run away out of state to my best friend and go to the same community college that they do but I feel like I'd just be burdening them because of my mental issues, and the fact I have romantic feelings for them just makes things even more messy. Many of my close friends have said he's abusive and neglectful but for some reason I just can't wrap my head around it and I feel like I'm being dramatic. My brain is always fogged and I'm almost a month clean from self harm but now I'm fully ready to relapse. This feels disgusting to admit but I'm possibly hypersexual and used to ""relieve myself"" as a last resort in order to calm down but now I can't even do that anymore without bursting into tears afterwards and being hit with a wave of guilt and shame. Cutting is the only thing that truly resets my emotions and keeps my flashbacks at bay and no one close to me knows about it. None of my healthy coping mechanisms work anymore either. Everything feels so out of reach.
There's so much more to this but I feel like I'm just going on about nothing at this point. I feel like my life is ruined and though I have no active plans to kill myself, I'm barely even living. I wouldn't be surprised if I make plans in the future, I've even thought of different methods, like jumping in front of a train, but I don't want to traumatize innocent people because of my own selfishness. And I don't have the balls to even cut deep so obviously I won't be able to take a blade to my wrist.
I just don't know where to even start. I'm not independent in the slightest. I want to reach out to other family members but I've never had close relationships with any of them really so the thought makes me anxious and I don't want it to seem like I only care about them when it comes to myself. Can someone just please tell me to not take my life? Tell me that I have something to live for? I feel like I'm only living for my best friend and a few others but I feel so replaceable and forgettable that everyone would just forget about me and move on in a month.",suicidewatch,,RV,21.2222313,76.0444182
Going to jump off a bridge tonight,"Honestly I’m just sick of this. I’m gonna turn 22 but I’ve been seeing psychiatrists and therapists for years now and I’m just as much in a shitty position as I was then. Yeah my family and friends will be upset but honestly I’m just apathetic. Call it selfishness or whatever. It doesn’t matter, we’re all so minute in the grand scheme of things that it really just doesn’t matter. 

Gonna do it tonight after work. I’m gonna buy some weed, booze, and cigarettes. Cigarettes for the fun of it, but the booze is the important part. I’ve made suicide attempts before but I chickened out. Not this time, the booze will lower my inhibition so that I can have the balls to fucking do it.

"I feel like the world is ending, and I'm scared to exist and scared of what will happen if I keep going","I'm 14, and for months now, my life felt like it was going great. My family and friends are supportive of me, and I get to start Testosterone soon. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and self-harm before, but its been months and I felt good. Well, as good as I can be in the us as a trans, genderqueer person with autism. Its not been perfect, my depression is always there in the background, and I still have days where I can't accomplish anything and I feel awful, and that feeling of uselessness and being incapable of doing most anything is present in most afternoons, though to a smaller extent. Its been getting worse over the past... I'm not sure. Days, weeks, ever since I entered my most recent school?

I went to a public school this year. It... wasn't good. I was the only trans and gay person, and the other kids thought I was disgusting. I was verbally harassed, kids would go out of their way to confuse me and take advantage of my autism, there was a constant swarm of feet kicking my shins or stepping on my toes, elbows slamming into me or knocking my stuff off a desk, an 'accidental' shove followed by laughter. Some kids went out of their way to openly and visibly bully me, especially one girl. I couldn't tell you what she did. I don't remember it. I went to the guidance counsellor, the nurse, the assistant principle, every adult I could reach- and I got nothing. Most of the time I was brushed off as if I was hysterical, or exaggerating, and even if what I said was acknowledged, the most that came of it was the one girl who targeted me stayed at least 5 feet away when taunting me. It didn't matter if it was directly in front of a teacher, if I spoke up about it instantly- I had always done something wrong, and nothing would come of it. Eventually, it reached the point where I was skipping more school than I was attending, and I learned nothing the entire year, so I just dropped out. It was the second year in a row this has happened.

I can't go into details because since then, my mind has been deteriorating. My memory was never good, but now its gotten way, way worse, and its blotted out much of what happened at school. My depression, which had been quiet and secluded, now creeps into my life almost every day. Each second that goes by its harder and harder to find motivation, or joy, or the will to live.

So, recently, it all got worse. I started crying and feeling incredibly depressed at stuff I wouldn't usually have that reaction to, everything felt way harder- and then today came. My parents told me and my sibling that we're moving. My state isn't the best, so I sort of knew this might happen- but it still shook me. My closest friend in the whole world, the best friend thats ever been in my life, lives 20 minutes away from me. We're going to a different state, to find my mom's dream place to live- and it'll be at least 2 hours away. No more Saturday morning visits to the bakery my mom's friend founded. No more trees I've grown up over the last 8 years pretending were my friends. No more several-time-a-week visits to my friend. If we move, my second best friend will be trapped in his house, a trans person with conservative parents, with no place to go and no support group and no way to protect himself. Everything feels like its falling apart. This feels like just another day, just another rock added to the boulder on my chest.

My parents have been keeping me in the dark as best they can about the world. I'm grateful. But even the small slice I have... everything is going wrong. All my fears are coming true. I can't remember the last time I was angry, not just hopeless. I can't remember the last time I screamed. I can't remember what it feels like to be happy, or to feel safe, or to be able to just appreciate something without constantly fearing what will happen.

I'm so scared. Suicide feels like the best option, the kindest option, the right option. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to tell my parents. I want to hope for this all to stop, for something good to happen, for these thoughts to go away, but everything gets worse. Every day is harder. I don't know what to do and I want it to stop being so hard to just exist",suicidewatch,,us,39.7837304,-100.445882

I have nothing. I am nothing.,"I’ve been in a state of suicide ideation on and off for over a decade now. But since February, maybe late January, I’ve been actively suicidal but trying hard not to kill myself. However I am fast approaching the end. 

I have struggled with mental health as long as I can remember. For years my mother thought I was just lazy and just didn’t want to go to school, it was so difficult to explain to the adults in my life what I was feeling, and demoralizing when they just didn’t understand. But then I was finally diagnosed at 13 with clinical depression i started to get help. It was a bit of a rollercoaster, I thought I could manage. However it just kept coming. Anxiety, c-ptsd, agoraphobia, OCD, then they said I had major depressive disorder. I lost my independence somewhere along the way. My anxiety kept getting in the way of my thirst of adventure. I lost my motivation when I lost my best friend to suicide. 

Wasn’t able to finish schooling, kicked out of multiple programs for being late to morning classes. It was so hard to push myself to get out the door, the anxiety and fear of failure, the depression telling me I’m alone in this now and forever. Then when I arrive they told me that my efforts aren’t good enough. So I couldn’t stick with it. It just got to a point where I was so far behind and i thought: what’s the point, i can’t hold down a job anyway, full or part time. 
I have to work sporadically or I get overwhelmed and nobody wants to have to babysit their employees feelings. Ironic considering the longest and most successful jobs I had were babysitting/child care gigs. 
And despite my need for routine, the stress and anxiety of scheduling has held me back. I can’t even get a drivers licence, the anxiety around driving is ridiculous. And i can’t afford to drive anyway. Using taxi services is a drain too. Bussing is a scheduling/social anxiety issue. My city isn’t the best for walking. Also my phone anxiety is back. I can barely make phone calls without overthinking everything I say and stumbling over myself. 

And now lately I’ve been hearing about BPD (borderline personality disorder), I read up on it and it seems to check most of not all the boxes. I wanted to call my intake therapist, she’s the one i mainly have seen and talked to, but she closed my file a while ago, because unless I’m having medication adjustments there’s no reason to see her, so I guess it’s all in my hands now. And that was an incredibly defeating experience, because I have proved to myself time and time again that I am incapable, currently i am no longer able. I’m too pessimistic now, and uncreative. I lack motivation without someone to encourage me without making me feel belittled. 
Now I’m terrified of seeing my family doctor and asking for another psychiatrist referral to discuss this (I’ve been through so many), because I’m afraid they will confirm my biggest fear: that I will never escape this vicious cycle. 

That what I’ve been experiencing now more than ever: the unstable relationships, abandonment issues, the ideation of people closest to me then the drop, the paranoia/fear or abandonment, the unhealthy emotional dependencies, the recklessness in sexual relationships, terrible self image, and the anxiety to depression pipeline, is a battle I will have to deal with my entire fucking life. That it will ebb and flow but always remain present so long as I hold people close. 
Nobody I know has the patience for that shit. I certainly don’t anymore. I can’t trust my own judgement anymore. I flip flop back and forth in my mind all the time on what is real and what is just paranoia/trauma talking. And when I settle on a negative idea, I then drop heavy emotions onto people who have full plates already. And as soon as I get reassured I am flooded with relief. Every is okay, it’s just in my mind. Until it isn’t. I don’t know where the triggers are anymore. I feel like being close to me is like walking through a field of landmines. 

I managed to keep the worst of my depression at bay for several years by closing myself off entirely from any kind of relationships that were too personal. Keeping everyone at arms length emotionally, mainly for their benefit. But that’s no longer an option. I made the fatal error of opening up again, this time to new people. I put so much love, trust, and faith into people I hardly knew and watch them fall like dominoes. I was encouraged to open up and now I’m paying for it. I just lost the last good friend I’ve had in a long time. I thought of them as my best friend, all the means is they are a safe person, a source of comfort, a person I can vent or drop a thought onto. Haven’t had one of those in a long long time and it didn’t last long either. I tried to avoid thinking of them in those exact terms because of what happened to my last best friend. But then they said it. So I believed it. Now it’s happening again. They are gone. And I’m alone. For good. 

I’m trying hard to be on my own again, to take back control of the narrative. But I’m failing at getting used to not sharing anything of myself again. After nearly 2 years of being kinda alive again, feeling wanted, feeling cared about.. suddenly being alone and unwanted is extremely unbearable. I’ve never felt so lonely, so repulsive and unloved in my whole life. To go from having people wanting to talk to you and hear your thoughts and chatter, ask you questions about yourself, wanting to just be around you, then to nothing at all. Just a passing wave at best. It cuts so deep. 
I’m starting to feel like they all were only there for themselves. Their own emotional fulfillment. That ALL relationships in life are just about what you can get out of them before they get stale, run dry and you have to put them out next to the bins. Why am I only just starting to understand this. I should’ve known. It always ends with me on my own. 
Having what I thought were true friends again was like finding an oasis after walking in the desert for years. But the oasis has dried up. All my friends are either gone or want distant friendships, they can’t stand being close to me. And that’s mostly my fault. I drove all the good people away by getting too attached. Too needy. Too much. 

My family loves me, I know. But I’m not a necessary addition to their overall lives. They are much closer to each other, I’m more of an afterthought. And I know it’s also my fault really, for shutting people out for so long. But it cuts deeply now. 

I have to push people to maintain the relationships. I feel I’m holding my loved ones hostage to me. They aren’t willing. 
Nobody wants to be around me anymore for more than a few pleasantries. And I can’t blame them. I’m exhausting.
I stopped being fun a long time ago. My paranoia, the fears of abandonment, the anxiety-depression cycle has become a yearly thing now. I always thought of myself as a non-dramatic person but I keep having so many uncontrollable emotional outbursts over the smallest of things, my brain betrays me and pushes my trauma and fears to the forefront resulting in irrational behaviour and that is unhealthy unnecessary self manufactured drama nobody should have to deal with. 
This makes me a horrible person to have around long term. Now I have nobody to talk to. Nobody to share my random thoughts with. Nobody is listening anymore, they don’t respond or want to be around me for long. They are sick of me. I AM SICK OF ME. I’m sick of hearing my own voice in my head on repeat. I can’t remember the sound of my friend’s and family’s voices anymore. They are so far away. 

The severe sleeping issues is what’s really driving me now to suicide now. I have trauma regarding sleep. It can be difficult to get a full nights rest because I need to feel safe. Which is why I haven’t gone to the hospital. (Also the mental health services here are notoriously shitty) It would only make this so much worse. Being in an environment that feels foreign and bright with strangers around me as i am feeling my most emotionally vulnerable would only break me. I would be thinking about home, my bed, my comfort zones and how my safe people don’t want me anymore.

The routine I had that helped for over a year is shattered and gone and with it the one last person who made me feel comforted and safe. They have put me on the shelf. Like a broken toy. I am a filthy stained teddy bear nobody wants to hold anymore after it was left out all night in the rain and thrown into the dryer haphazardly. So for 3 weeks Ive cried myself to sleep every night with grief feeling disconnected from everyone also with the knowledge I’ve killed another important friendship and wake every couple hours throughout the night due to nightmares. I don’t feel safe going to bed anymore. I’ve always had issues with sleep but the stress of losing the last few good things in my life is triggering it to the extreme now, also knowing what’s coming in my dreams. Violence and death on repeat every night. And I wake up alone and remember I have no one to turn to in hard moments anymore and I get upset all over again.

I just barely survived my best friend killing herself when we were 17. The only thing that stopped me from ending it back then was the knowledge of what it would do to my mom. I couldn’t put her through what I was/am going through. I knew it would wreck her if I died. But I’m at my wits end. I find myself increasingly apathetic to her pain in this inevitable conclusion. 

This year, coming up is the 10 year death anniversary. Her birthday was yesterday so I’ve been thinking about it more and more. Much more than I did last year. Her suicide has revealed a lot to me. Of how mine is going to be handled after I am gone. What I learned is that everyone moves on eventually. Some quicker than others. My death will only have a profound impact on two people, my mother, my brother. Part of me wishes I could turn to them for help but my relationship with my brother mostly exists when I reach out in pain, and that feels selfish, I can’t go to him more because he’s too good and giving and I know I will ruin it if I reach out too many times like I have with others. He is a person content on his own. And my mother and I have a deep history: she’s a balm to my aching anxiety, a parachute. But a stressor for my depression. Crowding me. When I ask for help her voice sounds critical and scolding. “Why didn’t you ___???” “You need to ___!”  She doesn’t understand. But I do. 
She’s been dealing with my depression and suicidal thoughts on and off for years so my tears and fears don’t carry any weight for her. Sort of like caregiver burnout. 
But what I didn’t know at 17 is that they are strong. Independent. Much more than I ever was or will be. My brother will support her through it and he has his own support for that, they will come out the other side of it closer. The family will rally around them. So I’m not so worried about it anymore. 

My tank is running on empty. 
I’ve basically made no progress. I’m back to square one. I’m on permanent disability because of how severely my mental health has effected my life, it’s impossible to get a job with my lack of qualifications and even harder to keep it with my low threshold for stress. Prolonged stress being a trigger for anxiety and suicide ideation. 
I tried exposure therapy for years and finding hobbies to help get me out and doing more
but with the cost of living rising I can barely afford to keep busy. And now I don’t have any friends anymore to turn to for comfort or distractions. I can’t feel anybody’s presence anymore. Sometimes I dissociate because of that. Occasionally people don’t feel like people anymore and that is terrifying to me now when years ago it was once a comfort. 
I’ve been trying to prepare the goodbye letters and messages, but I’ve said it so many times, written so many over the years. Anyone that needs a goodbye they can probably find them scattered in my journals at home, written throughout the years. So it feels like such wasted emotional energy for me. 
Maybe I’ll write a small note, a nice something for my mom and brother, an apology. But everyone else won’t give a shit in a couple years anyway. 

The only thing stopping me now is not having a easy to execute plan. I’m too cowardly to do something that could end up being drawn out and painful. I’m in Canada so no accessible guns. 
I had been thinking of jumping off my balcony for weeks now. But a 4 story jump is said to have a 50% suicide rate. Im more likely to cripple myself. Especially now it recently snowed, no pavement to land head first. 
The latest heavy snowfall in my city has made travel difficult, getting to the train is already difficult enough with my agoraphobia. I got nothing at home to get it done other than an assortment of pills. But I had a bad experience with pills before that I’m afraid to repeat. And it would be cruelty to allow my mother to find my body. I would have to go down to the stairwell or something but then someone else might find me before it’s done. I don’t want to die outside in the cold. I want to be warm. I want to feel physical warmth if I’m not capable of emotional warmth anymore 

I wanted to wait until my birthday later in May, I liked the symmetry, a closed loop. And the fact that my birthday could stand as my death anniversary, no need for my mom to hold vigil multiple days every year for the rest of her life. But I can’t stand this endless loneliness and not feeling safe enough to get some decent rest. 
I’m getting extremely desperate, and I don’t wear desperation well. It makes me look hideous. My birthday feels too far away. 

Im writing this and sending it off into the internet void because I no longer have anyone to say things to. I used to be content with that. I could’ve make my exit quietly without fuss years ago. But now I need to say things. I need to share.

This year, coming up is the 10 year death anniversary. Her birthday was yesterday so I’ve been thinking about it more and more. Much more than I did last year. Her suicide has revealed a lot to me. Of how mine is going to be handled after I am gone. What I learned is that everyone moves on eventually. Some quicker than others. My death will only have a profound impact on two people, my mother, my brother. Part of me wishes I could turn to them for help but my relationship with my brother mostly exists when I reach out in pain, and that feels selfish, I can’t go to him more because he’s too good and giving and I know I will ruin it if I reach out too many times like I have with others. He is a person content on his own. And my mother and I have a deep history: she’s a balm to my aching anxiety, a parachute. But a stressor for my depression. Crowding me. When I ask for help her voice sounds critical and scolding. “Why didn’t you ___???” “You need to ___!”  She doesn’t understand. But I do. 
She’s been dealing with my depression and suicidal thoughts on and off for years so my tears and fears don’t carry any weight for her. Sort of like caregiver burnout. 
But what I didn’t know at 17 is that they are strong. Independent. Much more than I ever was or will be. My brother will support her through it and he has his own support for that, they will come out the other side of it closer. The family will rally around them. So I’m not so worried about it anymore. 

My tank is running on empty. 
I’ve basically made no progress. I’m back to square one. I’m on permanent disability because of how severely my mental health has effected my life, it’s impossible to get a job with my lack of qualifications and even harder to keep it with my low threshold for stress. Prolonged stress being a trigger for anxiety and suicide ideation. 
I tried exposure therapy for years and finding hobbies to help get me out and doing more
but with the cost of living rising I can barely afford to keep busy. And now I don’t have any friends anymore to turn to for comfort or distractions. I can’t feel anybody’s presence anymore. Sometimes I dissociate because of that. Occasionally people don’t feel like people anymore and that is terrifying to me now when years ago it was once a comfort. 
I’ve been trying to prepare the goodbye letters and messages, but I’ve said it so many times, written so many over the years. Anyone that needs a goodbye they can probably find them scattered in my journals at home, written throughout the years. So it feels like such wasted emotional energy for me. 
Maybe I’ll write a small note, a nice something for my mom and brother, an apology. But everyone else won’t give a shit in a couple years anyway. 

The only thing stopping me now is not having a easy to execute plan. I’m too cowardly to do something that could end up being drawn out and painful. I’m in Canada so no accessible guns. 
I had been thinking of jumping off my balcony for weeks now. But a 4 story jump is said to have a 50% suicide rate. Im more likely to cripple myself. Especially now it recently snowed, no pavement to land head first. 
The latest heavy snowfall in my city has made travel difficult, getting to the train is already difficult enough with my agoraphobia. I got nothing at home to get it done other than an assortment of pills. But I had a bad experience with pills before that I’m afraid to repeat. And it would be cruelty to allow my mother to find my body. I would have to go down to the stairwell or something but then someone else might find me before it’s done. I don’t want to die outside in the cold. I want to be warm. I want to feel physical warmth if I’m not capable of emotional warmth anymore 

I wanted to wait until my birthday later in May, I liked the symmetry, a closed loop. And the fact that my birthday could stand as my death anniversary, no need for my mom to hold vigil multiple days every year for the rest of her life. But I can’t stand this endless loneliness and not feeling safe enough to get some decent rest. 
I’m getting extremely desperate, and I don’t wear desperation well. It makes me look hideous. My birthday feels too far away. 

Im writing this and sending it off into the internet void because I no longer have anyone to say things to. I used to be content with that. I could’ve make my exit quietly without fuss years ago. But now I need to say things. I need to share. 
I just want to be heard again but nobody is listening",suicidewatch,,Canada,61.0666922,-107.991707
What is the best way to commit suicide?,"Long story short: I wasn’t even depressed, actually complete opposite - I loved life, was taking care of my health, wanted to live as long as possible. I was passionate about a lot of things had huge plans for my future, I was just stressed and anxious and wanted to hop on SSRI that has already helped me twice in the past (and I tolerated it extremely well, barely had any side effects), just for a few months, because I had a lot of plans in the upcoming months (traveling, business, etc.) Sadly it didn’t work the same way as in the past, quite the opposite - I lost all of my emotions (both positive and negative - feeling completely flat no empathy, no love, no joy, no sadness, nothing… cant even feel hunger and thirst), got constant ringing in my head, feel foreign in my own body, constant DPDR, feeling of my skin and genitals is totally muted, I got severe cognitive issues, I don’t even have spontaneous thoughts in my mind - it’s just blank, my gut is totally destroyed - can’t even eat everything I want like before (never had any issues with food intolerance or anything like that), lost all my dreams, passions, hobbies, and what’s worst I lost all hope for the future and faith. 

It’s just ironic that a person who was not even depressed got something worse than any depression in the world because of ANTIDEPRESSANTS. It has been months since that incident and every day is pure suffering and agony. It was supposed to be the best time of my life, but I turned into a housebound vegetable that can’t even take care of myself alone. All of this because of 1 pill of a medicine that was supposed to help me like it did in the past. I’d be healthier (and happier) doing street drugs instead… i didn’t even do drugs, I was taking care of myself and my health and all of that for nothing because of a “MEDICINE” and there is no cure for it. I’m in my late 20s and had a great future ahead, but now everything is ruined because of this mistake and it seems that suicide is the only option. I can’t stand this suffering knowing how much I couldve accomplished if it wasn’t for that mistake I would be living my best life right now. I wish i could just go back to this day and not reach for this devil’s pill…

It’s a shame as much as I loved life, it’s all gone forever, I can’t live like this and watch everything I waited for pass me by like this while I’m a vegetable. Nothing has meaning anymore, I’d rather just have a severe clinical depression or even cancer than be chemically lobotomized like this… One mistake and poof… here I am contemplating suicide every moment, it feels like I shouldn’t breathe anymore.

So as it says in the topic - what is the best way to go to the other side? Something peaceful with no pain, I’ve had enough of suffering already. Maybe some drugs to OD just go to sleep and never wake up again?

Spinal cord is being attacked on both ends now,"Got diagnosed with cysts that are pressing into my s1 and possibly causing something called cauda equina syndrome. I already live with craniocervical instability with brainstem compression that is causing weakness and numbness in my whole body along with cranial nerve problems. Neither one of these conditions have more than a handful of doctors who will help you around the world. I was scheduled to go to Colorado to deal with cranio cervical instability, but I'm not sure if I can even get over there safely now with cauda equina.

My dipshit family doesn't understand the gravity of my situation and that I can't get out of the burning building alive. I have to jump from this building because otherwise I might be bed bound for the rest of my life for wheelchair bound at the very least with my brain stem not working properly. Craniocervical instability usually progresses to being bed bound and dying in your bed If not traded. I want assisted suicide to avoid that especially horrible fate but my family will not help me attain it. 

So I'm going to have to kill myself by riskier unless friendly means means means. Probably gas inhalation of some kind.

"Once I sort out everything for my family, I will be gone","Hello,

I'd appreciate it if you read this.

I'm 20, male, from England.

I've been on anti-depressants and had therapy for years (quit therapy about a year ago because it was only doing worse).

I have ups and downs. On my ""ups"", I know I still don't want to be here, but I don't have the confidence to do anything. Right now I'm on a ""down"" and I think I'm ready to do it.

I can't tell you what's wrong - I wish I knew. I lived with my mildly abusive mother for about 6 years, but I don't believe that contributes to this. Recently, I think loneliness has just been killing me, I really feel like I need somebody to love. Though, even while I had a girlfriend, I still had these feelings. Maybe it's just meant to be?

Talking of ""meant to be"", I'm agnostic but three nights ago I prayed. I just wanted anything. I asked for a sign that something is out there caring for me, anything which wants me to live. I don't believe I had any sign.

I'm planning on being gone by tomorrow or Sunday. I have a list of the things which needs done by then.

- Write notes for the people I care most about; my father, my sister, my ex (we're still very close), my very close internet friend, my mother, my job (we're an SME and I'm hoping the shock of a suicide will show them that the signs of depression really aren't noticeable - I basically just want them to know I commit suicide, no details), and my best friend - my dog.

- Tidy up my possessions. I still live with my father and I'm hiding vapes and two 3D printed dildos from him, really don't want him to discover that after my death.

- I own a server with my sisters and brother-in-laws contents on it. I will make sure they have those.

- General House tidy. I have some clothes to wash and guitars hanging around. I want to make sure everything is clean and no chores required for my father.

My father is incredibly sensitive. He's near to crying upon the mention of a funeral, so it's so difficult to do this to him. I was initially thinking of inhaling an inert gas such as nitrogen, though I'm worried about releasing the gas into the house. And most notably, I don't want my father to discover my body.

I've tried choking myself to see if I would have the confidence to kill myself, and I have managed to make myself pass out a few times. Therefore, I think that is the method I will use.

I think I've typed enough for now, but I'm completely open for suggestions and questions (honestly happy if my life is a case study, feel free to ask about my life and feelings - nothing is disrespectful).

Notably, I think I've heard every suggestion/advice there is. Thank you for anything you may say, but I don't think it's necessary.

Much love to you and the world.",suicidewatch,,England,52.5310214,-1.2649062
just a rant,"hey guys, i just need to vent a little before i explode. i'm so tired, tired of feeling like this. i know it’s depression creeping back in—i can literally feel it sitting on my chest. I just wish I could be a normal teenager, one of those shallow ones whose biggest worry is finding the perfect outfit for the next concert or planning the ultimate sleepover for their huge group of friends. but no, i’m me, and i’ve been like this for as long as i can remember.

i’ve always felt alone or left out, either by family or friends. as a kid, i just wanted to feel okay around people, to not feel like the weird one or like they were getting tired of me being there. i remember that feeling so good because i still feel it today. back then, i didn’t really care much—i was just a kid. but now… now i know how much all of that affects me.

anyway, i'm going off track. I just wanted to say that it's getting harder to stay here every day, especially when there's nothing really keeping me here. i guess my mom, maybe. sometimes i feel like she's just as lonely as i am. i wish i had siblings so they could take care of her after i’m gone. but it's just me, and i have to deal with that.

i've thought about numbing myself with medications just to feel a little better. the thought crosses my mind a lot, but i’m scared of getting addicted—like i did with self-harm—so instead, i bought a coloring book to pass the time. Hopefully, it helps for now.

thanks for reading this far, it really means a lot. see ya.

My life will never be normal again(please read everything... please),"In 2021, everything in my life got fucked up. The results of the happening's in 2021, caused the next 4 years of my life to get ruined as well, Present day 03/31/2025. My life has only been getting worse and worse, day by day its sonething new. Let me explain how life was before 2021, and how life was after 2021, to compare and contrast, and to show you where my life is now. 

2006-2014 I was getting bullied in pre and middle school and had no friends, saw many 8th graders wth girlfriends but I was the quiet awkward kid that was just made fun of, so I didnt even fathom it for me to be a possibility in this lifetime to have a relationship of any kind, which is how fucked up i was from how these kids treated me. 

Then come 2015 high school starts, I don't get bullied but I don't have friends or any place to sit by lunch, so I let shit ride out, I try to get put on benzos for my panic attacks but the doctors won't prescribe benzos to children under 18, so I just deal with the crippling anxiety and panic attacks until I get a schedule change to start in January of 2016.

2016 starts, and who do I see in my new math class, the kid who used to bully me in middle school, but the funniest part is we started chopping it up and we became good friends, to this present day 2025 hes my closest best friend. He introduced me into his friend group and let me sit at their table, he'd also introduced me into trying weed, which i ended up enjoying, and try to smoke as often as I can lmao, we enjoyed the summer of 2016, and even despite not even kissing or having sex with a girl in my life ever(unlike my bestfriend and his friends) I had friends and i belonged so I didn't care, then 2017 arrived it was pretty much the same thing minus the friendgroup who'd abandoned me and my bestfriend, as well as my bestfriends girl leaving my bestfriend for one of the people in the friendgroup which was no longer our friend group. So we hung around a bunch of Randoms my bestfriend was involved with drug dealing wise or just for company. Enough of 2017, moving onto to 2018. 

2018 was the year I met the first girl I fell in love with, we kissed once lmao, and then after that she tried to ghost me because she didn't like the way i kissed, then after fucking a bunch of other guys, she walks up to me in the hallway like nothing happens and tries to be on talking terms, having no one else is fold, so we talk and she starts dropping hint like ""i could teach you how to kiss"" and etc. I brushed it all off because part of me hated this beatfriend with benefits  
position she was trying to put me in, knowing how much I truly loved her. While she'd coochie coo with me and then get her back blown out by like 3 guys behind my back. But I still had feeling for her so I'd talk to her everyday, even when I didn't want to, she was the reason I had so much stress and went from smoking on weekends to a few times throughout the day 24/7. She had changed me in a bad way, much more depressed. 

2019 came, i got my first car ever, but my bestfriend being a fucking dumb ass, decided to drive the car behind my back and ended up wrecking it, it was a bmw with 14 thousand miles only. It was like brands new. I had it for literally 3 days, I was depressed about it, but life happens and eventually I got over it. I went to Florida that summer with my best friend. Had fun working at a sushi place, played basketball in the summer, did many enjoyable things to forget.

Then 2020 came, probably the most peaceful enjoyable year of my life. I got a new car which was faster and the same price as the one that crashed. I started talking to the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid my eyes on, we started off as friends but it was becoming something more, she was a little weird, like sitting at home not leaving her room type, but her beautiful face, her personality, and to not sound perverse, but god given body were 3 thibgs to make this girl a solid 11/10. But then one day my barber was drunk on the job and gave me the wrong fucked up hair cut, so I couldn't ask her out anymore. Months passed by we were still talking everyday, but eventually I realized this is all she wanted. Someone to talk to non stop on the phone, she didn't want to feel real intimacy, real connection, touch, things required for both men and women. So I just let it fade away until we mutually stopped talking together, but while we were talking together, I had lost my virginity(or the only time I've had sex in my life up to this date) while I was talking to the amazing girl I was mentioning above. And all I could think was, it should of have been her, we'll call the first girl(heartbreaker) nyeria, the second girl i actually liked(angel) nichelle, and the girl I lost my virginity too and have never had sex after that(skank)cam. I moved into my best friends grandmas house briefly for like 2 months but it didn't work out being it was a studio.

Those were the years which I thought everything would start becoming better year by year, I had many goals for 2021, but you'll see the downfall start now 

On December 31st 2020, I was burned on accident by a pot of boiling hot pasta water, went to the clinic and everything was fine, I was still healthy and had no problems at this point at my life, everything in my life was organized, from my belongings to my mind(the most important part) 
Then after my leg healed up I started to feel this power within myself, this strong positivity and confidence, like I was on top of the world, I felt more sharp, and focused, healthier, and way happier. I started working out like crazy for the first time in my life, and upon checking my alternative snap, I see that ""nyeria"" added me, so I add her and despite my displeasure, I still had feeling so I started talking to her, she still wanted to have sex and I was finally ready, just needed to get some viagra. 2021 was starting off strong (or so i thought lmao, could not have been more wrong) I rode with the feeling, and then things started happening, like people who'd never give me respect would give me respect, I'd get nice free stuff I'd never even asked for, red-lights would keep turning green, cats would weirdly move out of my way. A series of stuff happening to me that had never really happened before... EVER, so I get into it too much and start watching these spiritual youtubers on YouTube and start taking the things they're saying seriously and trying to apply it to how my life is, sone of it was true some of it wasn't. But ultimately I now feel like im the spiritual man with power, so I start acting a little irrationally. At this point with the power i ""felt i was feeling"" i didnt care about having sex with that girl, even she was my first kiss and first girl I fell in love with etc. It didn't matter at that point, I just felt like more important things were happening. So I stopped smoking weed because the way i was feeling, it couldn't even get me high, I get $50 exactly from someone for something that I used to buy this psychedelic substance called mad honey(because ib my mind i thought the price of the mad honey being $50 and me having $50 meant i was supoosed to purchase this assuming taking mad honey was a part of my spiritual quest. This is the point where everything goes down hill. I take the mad honey and trip hard and attacked my mom, there was no severe damage but I had saw demons and I was scared beyond my life and after attacking her, I somehow end up in my bedroom with lights off bolting outta bed every 10 seconds thinking I'm out of the trip, but I'm still in it, so then officers arrive and crowd into my room and make me get on an ambulance, i get discharged the same day.  Then my dad is rampant of looking for weed rehabs for me so he starts dragging me to these retarded fucking weed rehabs, I think like a good 3 or 4 of them, until I got tired and fed up with visiting those rehabs i wasnt going to go to and decided I'd just live on the road with my parents credit card, so I packed up my script benzos, script codeine and promethazine lean, my hydrocodone, and alcohol in a bag, plus my basketball, and just dipped on them and went to the double tree(who ended up not charging us) then I left the double tree to go to court for my speeding ticket. After that, I made the hugest mistake of my life #1. Follow this Maserati to ask car shop, literally only to ask him where the dispensary is so i could get a med card(being 20 at the time, the bad ugly mother fucking and his demented fat friend made me spell it on a posted note, and I waited for them to come back when in reality I should've just dipped and never came back, instead I was greeted by Lombard police forcing me to get out my car and get onto a fucking ambulance and then for the first time in my life stay at a mental hospital for like 3-4 days I think. I then got out and was sent to this place rosecrance which was very nice. Great all you can eat food, we got cigarettes, pretty counselor, chill guys, nothing really to worry about, but I was a little manic thinking strange thibgs in my head and they could notice it, so they sent me to the mental health facility of rosecrance sons other place, it was alright but nothing as good as the other rosecrance was. In hindsight, I should've just sticked it out and got my head together, figured out I'm not a supernatural guy, or my moms evil, or my dads some type of god, whatever weird shit was going on in my head, but none of this weird shit would've started in my head if these nice coincidences happen, like wanting nicotine and not even looking the girls way and 2 seconds later she offers you nicotine, or girls being sweet on me who would have never before, getting free pizza from the guy who's never done that from the 10 years I had known him at that point(14 now) or the many other things I could mention but have decided to leave it for the sake of getting on with the story. So I asked my parents to pick me up and get me out this rehab place, they reluctantly did. I had odd behavior, like going in the oasis(like a rest area but better) and walking in without my mask because I felt my power could protect me. When we got home my perception was just skewed, I saw my dad as some kind of god like person and my mom as a demonic person. I would just do little harmless weird things around the house. So one day i text nyeria a bunch of hurtful things and she blocks me, i do ot hecause im sexretly convinced shes a demon of some kind or my secret hapf sister no ones told us about, she did kind of look like me. So one day i make the mistake of unadding a bunch people on snapchat, because I'm thinking that they're demons or people on the dark side... I removed ""nichelle"" of my snapchat, the girl I liked the absolute most more than anyone, the girl im still in love with to this day. The most beautiful perfect girl in this world. While I was in my mind state I didnt think anything of it. So the damage i had caused myself had been bad but was undeniably gonna become worse, lost an easy good looking bootycall, and lost the love of my life who i was waiting for the right time to rekindle things with, but becoming manic can happen outta nothing. So the next day my mom makes food and I'm paranoid she's poisoned it, and try to throw it outside, but my dad stops me, he then tells me were going a trip, he lies and brings me to the mental hospital, where this faggot tall fat big pussy bitch forces me to strip into a gown or hell get people to hold me down and do it. They then leave me in that hospital for 10 days with multiple fucked antipsychotics that don't help me feel less antisychotic, because in reality, I was just a boy on the Autism spectrum drawing conclusions from coincidences or special stuff that normally doesn't happen to the extent of it happening being crazy in my eyes leading me to think from one thing to another forming nonsensical ideas and skewing my perception. All the antipsychotics did was make me gain weight, get headaches, and make me depressed. After I got out of hospital #2 my dad told me in the car he'd threw out $5000+ worth of my codeine and promethazine syrup, that I was going to be forced to go to outpatient for weed even i hadn't been smoking it for like a month, and he had kept my car in someone's driveway for a couple months ""till I deserve it again"" almost forgot, he rearranged my room and threw away a bunch of my weed paraphernalia, other stuff that was important to me not related to weed. Then he started forcing me to get vaccinated, I told him a hundred times I'd won't but he'd keep bothering me like on some really obsessive creepy shit, so after a month of bothering, I went against my fears and got one shot only, never any after that. I regretted it so much, and I was someone mad about putting that fucked up poison in my body especially after everything i had already went through, this was the worst thing, because i could've lost relationships with beautiful women, i could've lost material possessions, money, designer drugs, and privilege of using a car, but my health was the most important thing to me, and they fucked that for me, those stupid fucking scared Indians want to shove needles up their ass and get blood clots a d cancer and die cuz they're fuxkibg stupid and don't understand thr vaccine was solely created to kill us, I was forced into taking it by them, so the love i had for my father disappeared, I hated him now for fucking my life up. 

Then 2022 came, I moved out and was chronically depressed since 2021, which is when it started May 16th,2021 after I got the vaccine. I couldn't look my friends in the eyes anymore have full conversations, feel present, smoke weed without getting anxiety, thinking about how i lost nyeria and nichelle(these are made up names to protect their real identities) I was slightly fat. The main thing i enjoyed doing was smoking weed and after the trauma of losing my lean, weed stuff, car, the 2 girls i could've had in my life, my health due to the vaccine, it was all too much so I just stayed away from weed from that point, until like a week later I fell into a pit of buying dispensary dab carts and poshes(vapes) and smo king them everyday ro ease my pain, and not see my parents. But to sum it up my bestfriends house was too dirty to stay in, so I moved out and started hanging out with the spiritual kid who made me lose 30 pounds, and things were going good until the feeling of power came back, I started not only feeling this new feeling of power, but a new add to the mix was that my mom was lightskin black and somehow I was gabgmember and part of the black p stones. I really in my mind drew this conclusion outta things that I really don't want to get into right now, but that was the case 

2023 was the same, living of the idea my ""real"" mom is a gangmember and my ""fake"" real mom is my stepmother, I just drove around not doing shit, hanging out with friends, going to the gym, doing drugs, the same old,(by the way i had a job in 2022 around the time i started losing my marbles again, but that doesn't matter."") One day i decide to do stunts in the basement and injure my shoulder, then when I come home I'm getting this special sense that I need to jump off the balcony, so i do; and in that exact moments the cop arrives, sick of their bs i don't want to respond to them, i didn't hurt anyone and its not their house so they can go fuck themselves, so basically I get intuition that I need to go to jail to by myself so I just punch the officer and end up going to jail where some of the deputy's treat me like a king, and some treat me like the garbage they themselves are (example beebee) but his son the other beebee was cool. Wrong, grote, strezlecki, the goats no one better than them. But then in November 2023 I get transferred to a fucking mental psych ward near Missouri 

They say I have pschitzoeffective, which i never did and don't, and put ke on fuckec up halidol and depakote where the haldol made me go from 144 pounds 5'11 to 189 pounds 5'11. Worse than that, every single day I'd get these out of body side effects, which were like going through hell times 11. But there was nothing I could do there. They beat people up there, and it was one to get beaten on the suspicion that I was spitting out my poisin medication but really it was my phlegm. There were many other bad things about but I'm not really going to go over those rn, have questions dm me. So 8 months in jail, 6 months in the hospital I'm out on bond, before I get accepted into mental health probation. The terms of my probation are driving all the way up to Wheaton twice a week just to piss, multiple court dates, probation officer meeting, and no drugs of any kind including alcohol, unless you can get a med card but i doubt mental health probation will allow that. Hopefully im through with probation ny November 16th 2025. I'm sick all of this shit 

So this is where I'm at present, i have completed no college, I used to get women in the past, but with all of the trauma I been through i hate myself and dont see myself seeking the comfort of any woman in this life time, i was 195 pounds with a big gut, my dad crashed my car while I was in jail so now I have no car, the whole reason I went to the jail and became a viral video with over 100 million views is hecause my parents decided to call the cops and new I was unstable and would do something to them to end up in jail, I lost the 2 only girls that I could've had any relationship with, my confidence is ruined from going to jails and hospitals. They're trying to lable me as Schitzo-effective and prescribe me those fucked up meds like haldol or abilify which have side effect like weight gain, head aches, and out of body attacks(being the worst side effext), and erectile dysfunction. I actually stopped taking those pills 2 months ago completely, and i still have erectyle dysfunction.I don't need these medications when I'm just a normal depressed guy realizing that I had lost my mind twice, and have come to terms wirh it. I lost my $5000 in codeine lean, I don't enjoy music anymore, i feel an empty void in my life, i have no motivation for living anymore, I hate myself and I have no self confidence, i don't look good anymore, I can barely get my dick up, I can't talk to girls, only ones I had a connection with and they're both gone forever. I'm stuck on probation, I'm 24 without a car, I'm fat depressed and overweight with erectile dysfunction, my psychiatrist i trying to stop lorazepam(the only medication which is supposed to be for my anxiety and pannic attacks) I don't want to be alive anymore, so much of my life has gone to shit, there's so much I didnt mention in these paragraphs because it was hard to incorporate the whole story. I am missing about 40%. So try to go off what you read. I keep praying we will get one redo with life, but it just doesn't seem possible, but at the same time, it does. Before 2021 I had everything i needed, I had the perfect life, not a single complaint, my body was right and my mind even righter, it's just sad to watch thibgs crumble before your very eyes. Have something beautiful, and just watch it turn completely to shit. I could've had any better relationship with my family. I would've had women in my life. I would have had my personal belongings, which meant a lot to me. I would've had my car. I would've been. In good health and in good shape, plus looked good too, I would've interest in my life, anx motivation to move forward, but i have none of that anymore.

My fellow human beings, do you feel we get one more redo at life from birth, to do everything right and perhaps make different or better mistakes, not the fucked up ones we made in this lifetime, I know it sounds stupid as fuck, but deep down I can't be the only one feeling this way, with a desire for a redo at life.

Maybe we're just better of killing ourselves, who even knows, because i can't keep going on with this life.

My life will never be normal again(please read everything... please),"In 2021, everything in my life got fucked up. The results of the happening's in 2021, caused the next 4 years of my life to get ruined as well, Present day 03/31/2025. My life has only been getting worse and worse, day by day its sonething new. Let me explain how life was before 2021, and how life was after 2021, to compare and contrast, and to show you where my life is now. 

2006-2014 I was getting bullied in pre and middle school and had no friends, saw many 8th graders wth girlfriends but I was the quiet awkward kid that was just made fun of, so I didnt even fathom it for me to be a possibility in this lifetime to have a relationship of any kind, which is how fucked up i was from how these kids treated me. 

Then come 2015 high school starts, I don't get bullied but I don't have friends or any place to sit by lunch, so I let shit ride out, I try to get put on benzos for my panic attacks but the doctors won't prescribe benzos to children under 18, so I just deal with the crippling anxiety and panic attacks until I get a schedule change to start in January of 2016.

2016 starts, and who do I see in my new math class, the kid who used to bully me in middle school, but the funniest part is we started chopping it up and we became good friends, to this present day 2025 hes my closest best friend. He introduced me into his friend group and let me sit at their table, he'd also introduced me into trying weed, which i ended up enjoying, and try to smoke as often as I can lmao, we enjoyed the summer of 2016, and even despite not even kissing or having sex with a girl in my life ever(unlike my bestfriend and his friends) I had friends and i belonged so I didn't care, then 2017 arrived it was pretty much the same thing minus the friendgroup who'd abandoned me and my bestfriend, as well as my bestfriends girl leaving my bestfriend for one of the people in the friendgroup which was no longer our friend group. So we hung around a bunch of Randoms my bestfriend was involved with drug dealing wise or just for company. Enough of 2017, moving onto to 2018. 

2018 was the year I met the first girl I fell in love with, we kissed once lmao, and then after that she tried to ghost me because she didn't like the way i kissed, then after fucking a bunch of other guys, she walks up to me in the hallway like nothing happens and tries to be on talking terms, having no one else is fold, so we talk and she starts dropping hint like ""i could teach you how to kiss"" and etc. I brushed it all off because part of me hated this beatfriend with benefits  
position she was trying to put me in, knowing how much I truly loved her. While she'd coochie coo with me and then get her back blown out by like 3 guys behind my back. But I still had feeling for her so I'd talk to her everyday, even when I didn't want to, she was the reason I had so much stress and went from smoking on weekends to a few times throughout the day 24/7. She had changed me in a bad way, much more depressed. 

2019 came, i got my first car ever, but my bestfriend being a fucking dumb ass, decided to drive the car behind my back and ended up wrecking it, it was a bmw with 14 thousand miles only. It was like brands new. I had it for literally 3 days, I was depressed about it, but life happens and eventually I got over it. I went to Florida that summer with my best friend. Had fun working at a sushi place, played basketball in the summer, did many enjoyable things to forget.

Then 2020 came, probably the most peaceful enjoyable year of my life. I got a new car which was faster and the same price as the one that crashed. I started talking to the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid my eyes on, we started off as friends but it was becoming something more, she was a little weird, like sitting at home not leaving her room type, but her beautiful face, her personality, and to not sound perverse, but god given body were 3 thibgs to make this girl a solid 11/10. But then one day my barber was drunk on the job and gave me the wrong fucked up hair cut, so I couldn't ask her out anymore. Months passed by we were still talking everyday, but eventually I realized this is all she wanted. Someone to talk to non stop on the phone, she didn't want to feel real intimacy, real connection, touch, things required for both men and women. So I just let it fade away until we mutually stopped talking together, but while we were talking together, I had lost my virginity(or the only time I've had sex in my life up to this date) while I was talking to the amazing girl I was mentioning above. And all I could think was, it should of have been her, we'll call the first girl(heartbreaker) nyeria, the second girl i actually liked(angel) nichelle, and the girl I lost my virginity too and have never had sex after that(skank)cam. I moved into my best friends grandmas house briefly for like 2 months but it didn't work out being it was a studio.

Those were the years which I thought everything would start becoming better year by year, I had many goals for 2021, but you'll see the downfall start now 

On December 31st 2020, I was burned on accident by a pot of boiling hot pasta water, went to the clinic and everything was fine, I was still healthy and had no problems at this point at my life, everything in my life was organized, from my belongings to my mind(the most important part) 
Then after my leg healed up I started to feel this power within myself, this strong positivity and confidence, like I was on top of the world, I felt more sharp, and focused, healthier, and way happier. I started working out like crazy for the first time in my life, and upon checking my alternative snap, I see that ""nyeria"" added me, so I add her and despite my displeasure, I still had feeling so I started talking to her, she still wanted to have sex and I was finally ready, just needed to get some viagra. 2021 was starting off strong (or so i thought lmao, could not have been more wrong) I rode with the feeling, and then things started happening, like people who'd never give me respect would give me respect, I'd get nice free stuff I'd never even asked for, red-lights would keep turning green, cats would weirdly move out of my way. A series of stuff happening to me that had never really happened before... EVER, so I get into it too much and start watching these spiritual youtubers on YouTube and start taking the things they're saying seriously and trying to apply it to how my life is, sone of it was true some of it wasn't. But ultimately I now feel like im the spiritual man with power, so I start acting a little irrationally. At this point with the power i ""felt i was feeling"" i didnt care about having sex with that girl, even she was my first kiss and first girl I fell in love with etc. It didn't matter at that point, I just felt like more important things were happening. So I stopped smoking weed because the way i was feeling, it couldn't even get me high, I get $50 exactly from someone for something that I used to buy this psychedelic substance called mad honey(because ib my mind i thought the price of the mad honey being $50 and me having $50 meant i was supoosed to purchase this assuming taking mad honey was a part of my spiritual quest. This is the point where everything goes down hill. I take the mad honey and trip hard and attacked my mom, there was no severe damage but I had saw demons and I was scared beyond my life and after attacking her, I somehow end up in my bedroom with lights off bolting outta bed every 10 seconds thinking I'm out of the trip, but I'm still in it, so then officers arrive and crowd into my room and make me get on an ambulance, i get discharged the same day.  Then my dad is rampant of looking for weed rehabs for me so he starts dragging me to these retarded fucking weed rehabs, I think like a good 3 or 4 of them, until I got tired and fed up with visiting those rehabs i wasnt going to go to and decided I'd just live on the road with my parents credit card, so I packed up my script benzos, script codeine and promethazine lean, my hydrocodone, and alcohol in a bag, plus my basketball, and just dipped on them and went to the double tree(who ended up not charging us) then I left the double tree to go to court for my speeding ticket. After that, I made the hugest mistake of my life #1. Follow this Maserati to ask car shop, literally only to ask him where the dispensary is so i could get a med card(being 20 at the time, the bad ugly mother fucking and his demented fat friend made me spell it on a posted note, and I waited for them to come back when in reality I should've just dipped and never came back, instead I was greeted by Lombard police forcing me to get out my car and get onto a fucking ambulance and then for the first time in my life stay at a mental hospital for like 3-4 days I think. I then got out and was sent to this place rosecrance which was very nice. Great all you can eat food, we got cigarettes, pretty counselor, chill guys, nothing really to worry about, but I was a little manic thinking strange thibgs in my head and they could notice it, so they sent me to the mental health facility of rosecrance sons other place, it was alright but nothing as good as the other rosecrance was. In hindsight, I should've just sticked it out and got my head together, figured out I'm not a supernatural guy, or my moms evil, or my dads some type of god, whatever weird shit was going on in my head, but none of this weird shit would've started in my head if these nice coincidences happen, like wanting nicotine and not even looking the girls way and 2 seconds later she offers you nicotine, or girls being sweet on me who would have never before, getting free pizza from the guy who's never done that from the 10 years I had known him at that point(14 now) or the many other things I could mention but have decided to leave it for the sake of getting on with the story. So I asked my parents to pick me up and get me out this rehab place, they reluctantly did. I had odd behavior, like going in the oasis(like a rest area but better) and walking in without my mask because I felt my power could protect me. When we got home my perception was just skewed, I saw my dad as some kind of god like person and my mom as a demonic person. I would just do little harmless weird things around the house. So one day i text nyeria a bunch of hurtful things and she blocks me, i do ot hecause im sexretly convinced shes a demon of some kind or my secret hapf sister no ones told us about, she did kind of look like me. So one day i make the mistake of unadding a bunch people on snapchat, because I'm thinking that they're demons or people on the dark side... I removed ""nichelle"" of my snapchat, the girl I liked the absolute most more than anyone, the girl im still in love with to this day. The most beautiful perfect girl in this world. While I was in my mind state I didnt think anything of it. So the damage i had caused myself had been bad but was undeniably gonna become worse, lost an easy good looking bootycall, and lost the love of my life who i was waiting for the right time to rekindle things with, but becoming manic can happen outta nothing. So the next day my mom makes food and I'm paranoid she's poisoned it, and try to throw it outside, but my dad stops me, he then tells me were going a trip, he lies and brings me to the mental hospital, where this faggot tall fat big pussy bitch forces me to strip into a gown or hell get people to hold me down and do it. They then leave me in that hospital for 10 days with multiple fucked antipsychotics that don't help me feel less antisychotic, because in reality, I was just a boy on the Autism spectrum drawing conclusions from coincidences or special stuff that normally doesn't happen to the extent of it happening being crazy in my eyes leading me to think from one thing to another forming nonsensical ideas and skewing my perception. All the antipsychotics did was make me gain weight, get headaches, and make me depressed. After I got out of hospital #2 my dad told me in the car he'd threw out $5000+ worth of my codeine and promethazine syrup, that I was going to be forced to go to outpatient for weed even i hadn't been smoking it for like a month, and he had kept my car in someone's driveway for a couple months ""till I deserve it again"" almost forgot, he rearranged my room and threw away a bunch of my weed paraphernalia, other stuff that was important to me not related to weed. Then he started forcing me to get vaccinated, I told him a hundred times I'd won't but he'd keep bothering me like on some really obsessive creepy shit, so after a month of bothering, I went against my fears and got one shot only, never any after that. I regretted it so much, and I was someone mad about putting that fucked up poison in my body especially after everything i had already went through, this was the worst thing, because i could've lost relationships with beautiful women, i could've lost material possessions, money, designer drugs, and privilege of using a car, but my health was the most important thing to me, and they fucked that for me, those stupid fucking scared Indians want to shove needles up their ass and get blood clots a d cancer and die cuz they're fuxkibg stupid and don't understand thr vaccine was solely created to kill us, I was forced into taking it by them, so the love i had for my father disappeared, I hated him now for fucking my life up. 

Then 2022 came, I moved out and was chronically depressed since 2021, which is when it started May 16th,2021 after I got the vaccine. I couldn't look my friends in the eyes anymore have full conversations, feel present, smoke weed without getting anxiety, thinking about how i lost nyeria and nichelle(these are made up names to protect their real identities) I was slightly fat. The main thing i enjoyed doing was smoking weed and after the trauma of losing my lean, weed stuff, car, the 2 girls i could've had in my life, my health due to the vaccine, it was all too much so I just stayed away from weed from that point, until like a week later I fell into a pit of buying dispensary dab carts and poshes(vapes) and smo king them everyday ro ease my pain, and not see my parents. But to sum it up my bestfriends house was too dirty to stay in, so I moved out and started hanging out with the spiritual kid who made me lose 30 pounds, and things were going good until the feeling of power came back, I started not only feeling this new feeling of power, but a new add to the mix was that my mom was lightskin black and somehow I was gabgmember and part of the black p stones. I really in my mind drew this conclusion outta things that I really don't want to get into right now, but that was the case 

2023 was the same, living of the idea my ""real"" mom is a gangmember and my ""fake"" real mom is my stepmother, I just drove around not doing shit, hanging out with friends, going to the gym, doing drugs, the same old,(by the way i had a job in 2022 around the time i started losing my marbles again, but that doesn't matter."") One day i decide to do stunts in the basement and injure my shoulder, then when I come home I'm getting this special sense that I need to jump off the balcony, so i do; and in that exact moments the cop arrives, sick of their bs i don't want to respond to them, i didn't hurt anyone and its not their house so they can go fuck themselves, so basically I get intuition that I need to go to jail to by myself so I just punch the officer and end up going to jail where some of the deputy's treat me like a king, and some treat me like the garbage they themselves are (example beebee) but his son the other beebee was cool. Wrong, grote, strezlecki, the goats no one better than them. But then in November 2023 I get transferred to a fucking mental psych ward near Missouri 

They say I have pschitzoeffective, which i never did and don't, and put ke on fuckec up halidol and depakote where the haldol made me go from 144 pounds 5'11 to 189 pounds 5'11. Worse than that, every single day I'd get these out of body side effects, which were like going through hell times 11. But there was nothing I could do there. They beat people up there, and it was one to get beaten on the suspicion that I was spitting out my poisin medication but really it was my phlegm. There were many other bad things about but I'm not really going to go over those rn, have questions dm me. So 8 months in jail, 6 months in the hospital I'm out on bond, before I get accepted into mental health probation. The terms of my probation are driving all the way up to Wheaton twice a week just to piss, multiple court dates, probation officer meeting, and no drugs of any kind including alcohol, unless you can get a med card but i doubt mental health probation will allow that. Hopefully im through with probation ny November 16th 2025. I'm sick all of this shit 

So this is where I'm at present, i have completed no college, I used to get women in the past, but with all of the trauma I been through i hate myself and dont see myself seeking the comfort of any woman in this life time, i was 195 pounds with a big gut, my dad crashed my car while I was in jail so now I have no car, the whole reason I went to the jail and became a viral video with over 100 million views is hecause my parents decided to call the cops and new I was unstable and would do something to them to end up in jail, I lost the 2 only girls that I could've had any relationship with, my confidence is ruined from going to jails and hospitals. They're trying to lable me as Schitzo-effective and prescribe me those fucked up meds like haldol or abilify which have side effect like weight gain, head aches, and out of body attacks(being the worst side effext), and erectile dysfunction. I actually stopped taking those pills 2 months ago completely, and i still have erectyle dysfunction.I don't need these medications when I'm just a normal depressed guy realizing that I had lost my mind twice, and have come to terms wirh it.

I'm stuck on probation, I'm 24 without a car, I'm fat depressed and overweight with erectile dysfunction, my psychiatrist i trying to stop lorazepam(the only medication which is supposed to be for my anxiety and pannic attacks) I don't want to be alive anymore, so much of my life has gone to shit, there's so much I didnt mention in these paragraphs because it was hard to incorporate the whole story.

In good health and in good shape, plus looked good too, I would've interest in my life, anx motivation to move forward, but i have none of that anymore.

My fellow human beings, do you feel we get one more redo at life from birth, to do everything right and perhaps make different or better mistakes, not the fucked up ones we made in this lifetime, I know it sounds stupid as fuck, but deep down I can't be the only one feeling this way, with a desire for a redo at life.

Maybe we're just better of killing ourselves, who even knows, because i can't keep going on with this life.

I then got out and was sent to this place rosecrance which was very nice. Great all you can eat food, we got cigarettes, pretty counselor, chill guys, nothing really to worry about, but I was a little manic thinking strange thibgs in my head and they could notice it, so they sent me to the mental health facility of rosecrance sons other place, it was alright but nothing as good as the other rosecrance was. In hindsight, I should've just sticked it out and got my head together, figured out I'm not a supernatural guy, or my moms evil, or my dads some type of god, whatever weird shit was going on in my head, but none of this weird shit would've started in my head if these nice coincidences happen, like wanting nicotine and not even looking the girls way and 2 seconds later she offers you nicotine, or girls being sweet on me who would have never before, getting free pizza from the guy who's never done that from the 10 years I had known him at that point(14 now) or the many other things I could mention but have decided to leave it for the sake of getting on with the story. So I asked my parents to pick me up and get me out this rehab place, they reluctantly did. I had odd behavior, like going in the oasis(like a rest area but better) and walking in without my mask because I felt my power could protect me. When we got home my perception was just skewed, I saw my dad as some kind of god like person and my mom as a demonic person. I would just do little harmless weird things around the house. So one day i text nyeria a bunch of hurtful things and she blocks me, i do ot hecause im sexretly convinced shes a demon of some kind or my secret hapf sister no ones told us about, she did kind of look like me. So one day i make the mistake of unadding a bunch people on snapchat, because I'm thinking that they're demons or people on the dark side... I removed ""nichelle"" of my snapchat, the girl I liked the absolute most more than anyone, the girl im still in love with to this day. The most beautiful perfect girl in this world. While I was in my mind state I didnt think anything of it. So the damage i had caused myself had been bad but was undeniably gonna become worse, lost an easy good looking bootycall, and lost the love of my life who i was waiting for the right time to rekindle things with, but becoming manic can happen outta nothing. So the next day my mom makes food and I'm paranoid she's poisoned it, and try to throw it outside, but my dad stops me, he then tells me were going a trip, he lies and brings me to the mental hospital, where this faggot tall fat big pussy bitch forces me to strip into a gown or hell get people to hold me down and do it. They then leave me in that hospital for 10 days with multiple fucked antipsychotics that don't help me feel less antisychotic, because in reality, I was just a boy on the Autism spectrum drawing conclusions from coincidences or special stuff that normally doesn't happen to the extent of it happening being crazy in my eyes leading me to think from one thing to another forming nonsensical ideas and skewing my perception. All the antipsychotics did was make me gain weight, get headaches, and make me depressed. After I got out of hospital #2 my dad told me in the car he'd threw out $5000+ worth of my codeine and promethazine syrup, that I was going to be forced to go to outpatient for weed even i hadn't been smoking it for like a month, and he had kept my car in someone's driveway for a couple months ""till I deserve it again"" almost forgot, he rearranged my room and threw away a bunch of my weed paraphernalia, other stuff that was important to me not related to weed. Then he started forcing me to get vaccinated, I told him a hundred times I'd won't but he'd keep bothering me like on some really obsessive creepy shit, so after a month of bothering, I went against my fears and got one shot only, never any after that. I regretted it so much, and I was someone mad about putting that fucked up poison in my body especially after everything i had already went through, this was the worst thing, because i could've lost relationships with beautiful women, i could've lost material possessions, money, designer drugs, and privilege of using a car, but my health was the most important thing to me, and they fucked that for me, those stupid fucking scared Indians want to shove needles up their ass and get blood clots a d cancer and die cuz they're fuxkibg stupid and don't understand thr vaccine was solely created to kill us, I was forced into taking it by them, so the love i had for my father disappeared, I hated him now for fucking my life up. 

Then 2022 came, I moved out and was chronically depressed since 2021, which is when it started May 16th,2021 after I got the vaccine. I couldn't look my friends in the eyes anymore have full conversations, feel present, smoke weed without getting anxiety, thinking about how i lost nyeria and nichelle(these are made up names to protect their real identities) I was slightly fat. The main thing i enjoyed doing was smoking weed and after the trauma of losing my lean, weed stuff, car, the 2 girls i could've had in my life, my health due to the vaccine, it was all too much so I just stayed away from weed from that point, until like a week later I fell into a pit of buying dispensary dab carts and poshes(vapes) and smo king them everyday ro ease my pain, and not see my parents. But to sum it up my bestfriends house was too dirty to stay in, so I moved out and started hanging out with the spiritual kid who made me lose 30 pounds, and things were going good until the feeling of power came back, I started not only feeling this new feeling of power, but a new add to the mix was that my mom was lightskin black and somehow I was gabgmember and part of the black p stones. I really in my mind drew this conclusion outta things that I really don't want to get into right now, but that was the case 

2023 was the same, living of the idea my ""real"" mom is a gangmember and my ""fake"" real mom is my stepmother, I just drove around not doing shit, hanging out with friends, going to the gym, doing drugs, the same old,(by the way i had a job in 2022 around the time i started losing my marbles again, but that doesn't matter."") One day i decide to do stunts in the basement and injure my shoulder, then when I come home I'm getting this special sense that I need to jump off the balcony, so i do; and in that exact moments the cop arrives, sick of their bs i don't want to respond to them, i didn't hurt anyone and its not their house so they can go fuck themselves, so basically I get intuition that I need to go to jail to by myself so I just punch the officer and end up going to jail where some of the deputy's treat me like a king, and some treat me like the garbage they themselves are (example beebee) but his son the other beebee was cool. Wrong, grote, strezlecki, the goats no one better than them. But then in November 2023 I get transferred to a fucking mental psych ward near Missouri 

They say I have pschitzoeffective, which i never did and don't, and put ke on fuckec up halidol and depakote where the haldol made me go from 144 pounds 5'11 to 189 pounds 5'11. Worse than that, every single day I'd get these out of body side effects, which were like going through hell times 11. But there was nothing I could do there. They beat people up there, and it was one to get beaten on the suspicion that I was spitting out my poisin medication but really it was my phlegm. There were many other bad things about but I'm not really going to go over those rn, have questions dm me. So 8 months in jail, 6 months in the hospital I'm out on bond, before I get accepted into mental health probation. The terms of my probation are driving all the way up to Wheaton twice a week just to piss, multiple court dates, probation officer meeting, and no drugs of any kind including alcohol, unless you can get a med card but i doubt mental health probation will allow that. Hopefully im through with probation ny November 16th 2025. I'm sick all of this shit 

So this is where I'm at present, i have completed no college, I used to get women in the past, but with all of the trauma I been through i hate myself and dont see myself seeking the comfort of any woman in this life time, i was 195 pounds with a big gut, my dad crashed my car while I was in jail so now I have no car, the whole reason I went to the jail and became a viral video with over 100 million views is hecause my parents decided to call the cops and new I was unstable and would do something to them to end up in jail, I lost the 2 only girls that I could've had any relationship with, my confidence is ruined from going to jails and hospitals. They're trying to lable me as Schitzo-effective and prescribe me those fucked up meds like haldol or abilify which have side effect like weight gain, head aches, and out of body attacks(being the worst side effext), and erectile dysfunction. I actually stopped taking those pills 2 months ago completely, and i still have erectyle dysfunction.I don't need these medications when I'm just a normal depressed guy realizing that I had lost my mind twice, and have come to terms wirh it. I lost my $5000 in codeine lean, I don't enjoy music anymore, i feel an empty void in my life, i have no motivation for living anymore, I hate myself and I have no self confidence, i don't look good anymore, I can barely get my dick up, I can't talk to girls, only ones I had a connection with and they're both gone forever. I'm stuck on probation, I'm 24 without a car, I'm fat depressed and overweight with erectile dysfunction, my psychiatrist i trying to stop lorazepam(the only medication which is supposed to be for my anxiety and pannic attacks) I don't want to be alive anymore, so much of my life has gone to shit, there's so much I didnt mention in these paragraphs because it was hard to incorporate the whole story. I am missing about 40%. So try to go off what you read. I keep praying we will get one redo with life, but it just doesn't seem possible, but at the same time, it does. Before 2021 I had everything i needed, I had the perfect life, not a single complaint, my body was right and my mind even righter, it's just sad to watch thibgs crumble before your very eyes. Have something beautiful, and just watch it turn completely to shit. I could've had any better relationship with my family. I would've had women in my life. I would have had my personal belongings, which meant a lot to me. I would've had my car. I would've been. In good health and in good shape, plus looked good too, I would've interest in my life, anx motivation to move forward, but i have none of that anymore.

My fellow human beings, do you feel we get one more redo at life from birth, to do everything right and perhaps make different or better mistakes, not the fucked up ones we made in this lifetime, I know it sounds stupid as fuck, but deep down I can't be the only one feeling this way, with a desire for a redo at life.

Maybe we're just better of killing ourselves, who even knows, because i can't keep going on with this life.

My life will never be normal again(please read everything... please),"In 2021, everything in my life got fucked up. The results of the happening's in 2021, caused the next 4 years of my life to get ruined as well, Present day 03/31/2025. My life has only been getting worse and worse, day by day its sonething new. Let me explain how life was before 2021, and how life was after 2021, to compare and contrast, and to show you where my life is now. 

2006-2014 I was getting bullied in pre and middle school and had no friends, saw many 8th graders wth girlfriends but I was the quiet awkward kid that was just made fun of, so I didnt even fathom it for me to be a possibility in this lifetime to have a relationship of any kind, which is how fucked up i was from how these kids treated me. 

Then come 2015 high school starts, I don't get bullied but I don't have friends or any place to sit by lunch, so I let shit ride out, I try to get put on benzos for my panic attacks but the doctors won't prescribe benzos to children under 18, so I just deal with the crippling anxiety and panic attacks until I get a schedule change to start in January of 2016.

2016 starts, and who do I see in my new math class, the kid who used to bully me in middle school, but the funniest part is we started chopping it up and we became good friends, to this present day 2025 hes my closest best friend. He introduced me into his friend group and let me sit at their table, he'd also introduced me into trying weed, which i ended up enjoying, and try to smoke as often as I can lmao, we enjoyed the summer of 2016, and even despite not even kissing or having sex with a girl in my life ever(unlike my bestfriend and his friends) I had friends and i belonged so I didn't care, then 2017 arrived it was pretty much the same thing minus the friendgroup who'd abandoned me and my bestfriend, as well as my bestfriends girl leaving my bestfriend for one of the people in the friendgroup which was no longer our friend group. So we hung around a bunch of Randoms my bestfriend was involved with drug dealing wise or just for company. Enough of 2017, moving onto to 2018. 

2018 was the year I met the first girl I fell in love with, we kissed once lmao, and then after that she tried to ghost me because she didn't like the way i kissed, then after fucking a bunch of other guys, she walks up to me in the hallway like nothing happens and tries to be on talking terms, having no one else is fold, so we talk and she starts dropping hint like ""i could teach you how to kiss"" and etc. I brushed it all off because part of me hated this beatfriend with benefits  
position she was trying to put me in, knowing how much I truly loved her. While she'd coochie coo with me and then get her back blown out by like 3 guys behind my back. But I still had feeling for her so I'd talk to her everyday, even when I didn't want to, she was the reason I had so much stress and went from smoking on weekends to a few times throughout the day 24/7. She had changed me in a bad way, much more depressed. 

2019 came, i got my first car ever, but my bestfriend being a fucking dumb ass, decided to drive the car behind my back and ended up wrecking it, it was a bmw with 14 thousand miles only. It was like brands new. I had it for literally 3 days, I was depressed about it, but life happens and eventually I got over it. I went to Florida that summer with my best friend. Had fun working at a sushi place, played basketball in the summer, did many enjoyable things to forget.

Then 2020 came, probably the most peaceful enjoyable year of my life. I got a new car which was faster and the same price as the one that crashed. I started talking to the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid my eyes on, we started off as friends but it was becoming something more, she was a little weird, like sitting at home not leaving her room type, but her beautiful face, her personality, and to not sound perverse, but god given body were 3 thibgs to make this girl a solid 11/10. But then one day my barber was drunk on the job and gave me the wrong fucked up hair cut, so I couldn't ask her out anymore. Months passed by we were still talking everyday, but eventually I realized this is all she wanted. Someone to talk to non stop on the phone, she didn't want to feel real intimacy, real connection, touch, things required for both men and women. So I just let it fade away until we mutually stopped talking together, but while we were talking together, I had lost my virginity(or the only time I've had sex in my life up to this date) while I was talking to the amazing girl I was mentioning above. And all I could think was, it should of have been her, we'll call the first girl(heartbreaker) nyeria, the second girl i actually liked(angel) nichelle, and the girl I lost my virginity too and have never had sex after that(skank)cam. I moved into my best friends grandmas house briefly for like 2 months but it didn't work out being it was a studio.

Those were the years which I thought everything would start becoming better year by year, I had many goals for 2021, but you'll see the downfall start now 

On December 31st 2020, I was burned on accident by a pot of boiling hot pasta water, went to the clinic and everything was fine, I was still healthy and had no problems at this point at my life, everything in my life was organized, from my belongings to my mind(the most important part) 
Then after my leg healed up I started to feel this power within myself, this strong positivity and confidence, like I was on top of the world, I felt more sharp, and focused, healthier, and way happier. I started working out like crazy for the first time in my life, and upon checking my alternative snap, I see that ""nyeria"" added me, so I add her and despite my displeasure, I still had feeling so I started talking to her, she still wanted to have sex and I was finally ready, just needed to get some viagra. 2021 was starting off strong (or so i thought lmao, could not have been more wrong) I rode with the feeling, and then things started happening, like people who'd never give me respect would give me respect, I'd get nice free stuff I'd never even asked for, red-lights would keep turning green, cats would weirdly move out of my way. A series of stuff happening to me that had never really happened before... EVER, so I get into it too much and start watching these spiritual youtubers on YouTube and start taking the things they're saying seriously and trying to apply it to how my life is, sone of it was true some of it wasn't. But ultimately I now feel like im the spiritual man with power, so I start acting a little irrationally. At this point with the power i ""felt i was feeling"" i didnt care about having sex with that girl, even she was my first kiss and first girl I fell in love with etc. It didn't matter at that point, I just felt like more important things were happening. So I stopped smoking weed because the way i was feeling, it couldn't even get me high, I get $50 exactly from someone for something that I used to buy this psychedelic substance called mad honey(because ib my mind i thought the price of the mad honey being $50 and me having $50 meant i was supoosed to purchase this assuming taking mad honey was a part of my spiritual quest. This is the point where everything goes down hill. I take the mad honey and trip hard and attacked my mom, there was no severe damage but I had saw demons and I was scared beyond my life and after attacking her, I somehow end up in my bedroom with lights off bolting outta bed every 10 seconds thinking I'm out of the trip, but I'm still in it, so then officers arrive and crowd into my room and make me get on an ambulance, i get discharged the same day.  Then my dad is rampant of looking for weed rehabs for me so he starts dragging me to these retarded fucking weed rehabs, I think like a good 3 or 4 of them, until I got tired and fed up with visiting those rehabs i wasnt going to go to and decided I'd just live on the road with my parents credit card, so I packed up my script benzos, script codeine and promethazine lean, my hydrocodone, and alcohol in a bag, plus my basketball, and just dipped on them and went to the double tree(who ended up not charging us) then I left the double tree to go to court for my speeding ticket. After that, I made the hugest mistake of my life #1. Follow this Maserati to ask car shop, literally only to ask him where the dispensary is so i could get a med card(being 20 at the time, the bad ugly mother fucking and his demented fat friend made me spell it on a posted note, and I waited for them to come back when in reality I should've just dipped and never came back, instead I was greeted by Lombard police forcing me to get out my car and get onto a fucking ambulance and then for the first time in my life stay at a mental hospital for like 3-4 days I think. I then got out and was sent to this place rosecrance which was very nice. Great all you can eat food, we got cigarettes, pretty counselor, chill guys, nothing really to worry about, but I was a little manic thinking strange thibgs in my head and they could notice it, so they sent me to the mental health facility of rosecrance sons other place, it was alright but nothing as good as the other rosecrance was. In hindsight, I should've just sticked it out and got my head together, figured out I'm not a supernatural guy, or my moms evil, or my dads some type of god, whatever weird shit was going on in my head, but none of this weird shit would've started in my head if these nice coincidences happen, like wanting nicotine and not even looking the girls way and 2 seconds later she offers you nicotine, or girls being sweet on me who would have never before, getting free pizza from the guy who's never done that from the 10 years I had known him at that point(14 now) or the many other things I could mention but have decided to leave it for the sake of getting on with the story.

While I was in my mind state I didnt think anything of it. So the damage i had caused myself had been bad but was undeniably gonna become worse, lost an easy good looking bootycall, and lost the love of my life who i was waiting for the right time to rekindle things with, but becoming manic can happen outta nothing. So the next day my mom makes food and I'm paranoid she's poisoned it, and try to throw it outside, but my dad stops me, he then tells me were going a trip, he lies and brings me to the mental hospital, where this faggot tall fat big pussy bitch forces me to strip into a gown or hell get people to hold me down and do it. They then leave me in that hospital for 10 days with multiple fucked antipsychotics that don't help me feel less antisychotic, because in reality, I was just a boy on the Autism spectrum drawing conclusions from coincidences or special stuff that normally doesn't happen to the extent of it happening being crazy in my eyes leading me to think from one thing to another forming nonsensical ideas and skewing my perception. All the antipsychotics did was make me gain weight, get headaches, and make me depressed. After I got out of hospital #2 my dad told me in the car he'd threw out $5000+ worth of my codeine and promethazine syrup, that I was going to be forced to go to outpatient for weed even i hadn't been smoking it for like a month, and he had kept my car in someone's driveway for a couple months ""till I deserve it again"" almost forgot, he rearranged my room and threw away a bunch of my weed paraphernalia, other stuff that was important to me not related to weed. Then he started forcing me to get vaccinated, I told him a hundred times I'd won't but he'd keep bothering me like on some really obsessive creepy shit, so after a month of bothering, I went against my fears and got one shot only, never any after that. I regretted it so much, and I was someone mad about putting that fucked up poison in my body especially after everything i had already went through, this was the worst thing, because i could've lost relationships with beautiful women, i could've lost material possessions, money, designer drugs, and privilege of using a car, but my health was the most important thing to me, and they fucked that for me, those stupid fucking scared Indians want to shove needles up their ass and get blood clots a d cancer and die cuz they're fuxkibg stupid and don't understand thr vaccine was solely created to kill us, I was forced into taking it by them, so the love i had for my father disappeared, I hated him now for fucking my life up. 

Then 2022 came, I moved out and was chronically depressed since 2021, which is when it started May 16th,2021 after I got the vaccine. I couldn't look my friends in the eyes anymore have full conversations, feel present, smoke weed without getting anxiety, thinking about how i lost nyeria and nichelle(these are made up names to protect their real identities) I was slightly fat. The main thing i enjoyed doing was smoking weed and after the trauma of losing my lean, weed stuff, car, the 2 girls i could've had in my life, my health due to the vaccine, it was all too much so I just stayed away from weed from that point, until like a week later I fell into a pit of buying dispensary dab carts and poshes(vapes) and smo king them everyday ro ease my pain, and not see my parents. But to sum it up my bestfriends house was too dirty to stay in, so I moved out and started hanging out with the spiritual kid who made me lose 30 pounds, and things were going good until the feeling of power came back, I started not only feeling this new feeling of power, but a new add to the mix was that my mom was lightskin black and somehow I was gabgmember and part of the black p stones. I really in my mind drew this conclusion outta things that I really don't want to get into right now, but that was the case 

2023 was the same, living of the idea my ""real"" mom is a gangmember and my ""fake"" real mom is my stepmother, I just drove around not doing shit, hanging out with friends, going to the gym, doing drugs, the same old,(by the way i had a job in 2022 around the time i started losing my marbles again, but that doesn't matter."")

Wrong, grote, strezlecki, the goats no one better than them. But then in November 2023 I get transferred to a fucking mental psych ward near Missouri 

They say I have pschitzoeffective, which i never did and don't, and put ke on fuckec up halidol and depakote where the haldol made me go from 144 pounds 5'11 to 189 pounds 5'11. Worse than that, every single day I'd get these out of body side effects, which were like going through hell times 11. But there was nothing I could do there. They beat people up there, and it was one to get beaten on the suspicion that I was spitting out my poisin medication but really it was my phlegm. There were many other bad things about but I'm not really going to go over those rn, have questions dm me. So 8 months in jail, 6 months in the hospital I'm out on bond, before I get accepted into mental health probation. The terms of my probation are driving all the way up to Wheaton twice a week just to piss, multiple court dates, probation officer meeting, and no drugs of any kind including alcohol, unless you can get a med card but i doubt mental health probation will allow that. Hopefully im through with probation ny November 16th 2025. I'm sick all of this shit

I lost my $5000 in codeine lean, I don't enjoy music anymore, i feel an empty void in my life, i have no motivation for living anymore, I hate myself and I have no self confidence, i don't look good anymore, I can barely get my dick up, I can't talk to girls, only ones I had a connection with and they're both gone forever. I'm stuck on probation, I'm 24 without a car, I'm fat depressed and overweight with erectile dysfunction, my psychiatrist i trying to stop lorazepam(the only medication which is supposed to be for my anxiety and pannic attacks) I don't want to be alive anymore, so much of my life has gone to shit, there's so much I didnt mention in these paragraphs because it was hard to incorporate the whole story. I am missing about 40%. So try to go off what you read. I keep praying we will get one redo with life, but it just doesn't seem possible, but at the same time, it does. Before 2021 I had everything i needed, I had the perfect life, not a single complaint, my body was right and my mind even righter, it's just sad to watch thibgs crumble before your very eyes. Have something beautiful, and just watch it turn completely to shit. I could've had any better relationship with my family. I would've had women in my life. I would have had my personal belongings, which meant a lot to me. I would've had my car. I would've been. In good health and in good shape, plus looked good too, I would've interest in my life, anx motivation to move forward, but i have none of that anymore.

My fellow human beings, do you feel we get one more redo at life from birth, to do everything right and perhaps make different or better mistakes, not the fucked up ones we made in this lifetime, I know it sounds stupid as fuck, but deep down I can't be the only one feeling this way, with a desire for a redo at life.

Maybe we're just better of killing ourselves, who even knows, because i can't keep going on with this life.

I can’t do this anymore,"I don’t know why I’m even writing this here. I’m a 33 year old man. Deeply depressed. And have lived in isolation the past 10 years.

The reason you may ask? It’s almost embarrassing to admit.

I have body dismorphia. 

BDD basically means I find myself too ugly to be seen or be loved. 

You want to hear the crazy part? It’s my left ear. 

Yes. My left ear makes my face ugly.

I know it sounds crazy. But I can’t help it.

I can’t live like this anymore. I have probably had 15 surgeries and I’m in $70k debt.

I just can’t do this anymore. 

I have tried to commit suicide probably 5-6 times. I’m a coward too. You may ask how could I fail that many times?

Well, the only way I’ve had the courage to do is drink alkohol and then take all the pills I’ve had.

I don’t understand how I’m alive. I’ve woken up in the hospital in the emergency unit (or whatever you call that in the US).

But now, I’m trying something else.

I’ve figured out that there are two artieries in the body that is deadly. In the neck and down the thigh. I’m going to cut that open, drunk, and bleed to death. 

That way I cannot fail.

I don’t want too.

I have no choice.

I can’t live looking like this.

I don’t deserve love. I don’t want anyone to be with me because they would settle.

I look at myself in disgust.

I have very high expectations of myself and I can’t reach them. 

I believe in Jesus. 

But I’m so afraid he’s not real.

And I’m so afraid I may go to hell.

But I can’t do this anymore.

I’m just a flawed human that been through so much trauma.

I can’t take rejection. It is like being stabbed in the heart each time.

I’m tired.

I just want to be loved. And be free.

I want to see myself in the mirror and just go out and enjoy life. 

But I can’t. 

I’ve lost everything these past 10 years.

Tomorrow I’ll do it. And I may write something here to not feel alone.

But it’s over. I know it is.

Sorry if this post annoys you.

i’m going to kill myself,"hi, i’m 16 years old, i have bpd and i’m in a long distance relationship with a narcissist that has ocd. i’ve been manipulated over and over and over for the past year and a half and i’m finally at my breaking point. our relationship started as two mentally ill kids meeting on the internet and having a crush on each other thinking they finally found the one person who understands them, and is now ending with me officially lying in my bed for 3 months straight, unable to go to school or work because there’s other boys there, and dealing with the aftermath of being forced to cut off my best friend of 4 years because she told him she didn’t agree with how he treats me. this relationship is impossible to leave, trust me i’ve tried. he’s manipulated my family into liking him more than me, he has all my social media accounts, if i try to leave he harasses me and my family nonstop and sends things to my house until i make SURE he agrees to getting help for his issues and then get back with him. as you can probably guess, he doesn’t get help. this is all i can do to protect my peace. don’t date people from the internet.",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
I’m done.,"On my main. I couldn’t care less who sees this anymore.

I quit my full-time job recently, my last day is April 17th. I couldn’t handle it anymore, the stress was overwhelming. Trying to essentially run a business alone for absentee owners with zero funding or resources is an insane ask.

My car is falling apart. It needs to go to the scrap yard, but I can’t get to my part time gig without a vehicle. So I’ll drive it until it dies.

I live alone and my rent alone is $1300/month, it was the cheapest apartment I could find. It’s infested with mice and roaches. I’m barely keeping my head above water.

I realized I should be panicking about potentially being evicted and ruining my life. But I’m just not. 

I have no close family. No real friends. A checked-out partner. Nobody to miss me.

My depression has been spinning out of control for weeks now and the meds aren’t working anymore. The only thing they do is numb me out and stop me from crying - an indulgence I sorely miss. My apartment is a pit of unwashed clothes and trash. All I do when I get home is sleep. 

I realized that I can’t fix my life. There’s no reason for me to keep going. There’s no hope for things to get better. I am utterly and completely useless. I am a miserable loser, alone and poor, and I always will be.

The only thing that was keeping me going was my animals, I love them like they are my children but I know their respective rescues will take them in with no hesitation and they will be well taken care of. 

So I’m done. I’m done with living my sad, pathetic little life.",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
Got the wool removed from my eyes,"No job. No money. No partner. Barely any “friends.” Everybody is selfish. Well my 28th birthday was just a few days ago. Barely anybody wished me happy birthday this year, a new low. But what’s got me most suicidal is how the older I get the more I realize how grim this world is if you’re not rich or one of the lucky ones in another way. Slavery still exists etc we haven’t progressed as humans, still the same as we our ancestors except the elite have gotten better at concealing it from the outside. Either we all start a revolution or I’m gone. The USA is the only place where I see people barely stick together to change the status quo. Been applying to jobs for months to jobs I’m qualified, overqualified for and nothing gives. And I know people in worse situations. Rich people only help other rich people stay rich. And I’m sick of people telling me to stick around in life, for what?!? So I can suffer more and even worse? My life is just bleak. I’m honestly starting to believe people just want me here for their own selfish reasons, so I could be used, exploited and taken advantage of.

I’m just stuck.,"Ever since middle school I have had on and off suicidal ideations. I even used to self harm but stopped after my parents threatened to put me away somewhere. I’m 28 years old now. Went to college, got my masters, attempted law school a couple years back but was academically dismissed. Since, I’ve tried to pivot and found work then was recently laid off. I can’t help but think that no matter how hard I try, it’s not meant for me to attain the things that I want and have continued to work for. Even though I got laid off, I tried taking it as a sign and then went back to preparing to apply to law schools again. This whole process has been a lot since my initial graduation date is coming up in May and I’m seeing my friends and former classmates graduate like how I thought I would this year. I thought at this age I’d be married or at least engaged yet I’m single and trying not to compare myself to my peers who are doing all of the things I’ve been trying to get to and thought I would have by now. During times like this I just think about all of the bad that’s happened to me (even things I haven’t mentioned like being SA’d, domestic violence, racism in academia/professional spaces, being betrayed by loved ones, etc.) and no matter how much I pray, journal, exercise, etc., the positive thoughts don’t even last long. I’ve always felt like a black sheep in my family, friendships, group activities/orgs. And not to mention I have a slight speech impediment that flares up when I’m nervous so I also think that prevents me from performing my best to get jobs and even to work when i am employed. I just don’t see the point in me having worked so hard to have things constantly happening to me back to back and it feels like no one else understands my POV. Like all I’ve done has been in vain. Idk I’ve cried all day and I don’t even cry more than maybe twice a year. I’m just lost right now. ",suicidewatch,,POV,49.0291838,21.307542657455574

I realized I can't bring myself to do it,"I realized that I'm not going to kill myself but I already ruined my life. 

I really don't think I can live a decent life, and sadly, it's my fault. I usually feel like I'm not a real human being, as if I can't function properly in society. I've always struggled with social anxiety and felt deeply ashamed of everything I do.

I’ve tried for years to overcome it, but I don’t think I ever will. Just being perceived by others makes me anxious. The only time I feel normal is when I'm drunk.

When I started college, I had severe anxiety issues, but I knew I needed a degree to get a good job. However, as time went on, I became more and more depressed, and attending college became unbearable. I eventually decided to end my life because I truly didn’t enjoy living, and at that moment, I was completely convinced I was going to do it.

I thought about my life and myself. I’ve been miserable for as long as I can remember, and I know it’s largely my fault. I tend to be extremely passive when it comes to my problems—I just sit back and ignore them, hoping they’ll resolve themselves. And since I knew I wouldn’t take action to improve my life, I thought the best option was to stop living.

The thing is, a year and a half has passed, and I’ve wanted to end my life every single day, but I haven't been able to go through with it. Now, I’m a 23-year-old college dropout with no work experience and no driver’s license.

I don’t feel sorry for myself because I know I did this to myself, but I genuinely have no idea what to do. I feel like my life is frozen. I don’t think I can function as an adult. I just want to stop existing, but every method I’ve looked into scares me. I feel incapable of doing anything on my own, even having a job. I often fantasize about taking drugs or experiencing something that could alter my brain chemistry because it feels like my brain is only half-functioning.

I don't what to do or where to start now that I realized that I'm not going to kill myself ",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
Struggling today,"I’ve been struggling for a long time now. But these past few months have gotten unbearable. I have so many reasons. One reason that I can’t even bring myself to speak about to even so much as think of. It has to be the worst thing I have ever experienced. I’m traumatized. And with the way the world is becoming more and more hateful. It’s too much to witness. I’ve become thousands in debt and I have $.30 to my name and I can’t afford food or pet food or clothes or to fix my car. Nothing. I grew up catholic and while I’m struggling worse than I ever have in my entire life, the family I grew up with has disowned me for being gay and having piercings and tattoos, my cousins marrying at 18, I just had another get married this weekend. I’ve been with my girlfriend for 4 years and would love nothing more than to marry her and start a family but I don’t see that happening ANY time soon as I keep getting further and further down this pit I’ve dug myself. But children can get married to people they have known less than a year, I can’t help but get angry. Especially knowing that with the religious beliefs they grew up in, divorce isn’t allowed. I watched their dad take all of their money and spend it on drugs, their mother BEGGED the pastor to let them get divorced and he said no. My uncle ended up killing himself with those drugs. And he did unspeakable things to me as a child…: and yet his children don’t see how terrifying it is to marry someone you barely know…? I’m so angry. I can’t be happy for anyone when I’m living in this misery every day. I genuinely want to kill myself now. I can’t stop thinking about it. I want to escape everything. I’m in so much internal pain. I have no friends and no one to talk to except my girlfriend who has to hear about this enough. I can’t keep letting my anger and hatred ruin everything around me. I’m just done. But I’m also a fucking pussy and can’t kill myself. I don’t even know how. I’m sure I can come up with something but it’s all painful and I’m too scared of the pain. I just want to sleep and not wake up. But sleeping meds aren’t for sure and I don’t want to continue living as a vegetable if I fail in shooting myself. I’ve talked to a psychiatrist and therapist but they are not helpful to me. I’ve stopped taking my meds and stopped taking care of myself. I stopped eating. I sleep too much. I hurt myself. I can’t stop being self loathing. I hate myself and my existence so badly and I genuinely cannot figure out how to get the help I need, or how to help myself to even want to try to live.

dont see the point in living anymore,"
hello ^^, im not sure if this is the place for this, more just writing this because ive always found writing to help me. as the title says, im pretty done with life. 

im 16 years old, turning 17 in may, and ive realized that i really do not want that. its not the age, its everything that comes with it. im behind on everything. 

due to some things when i was about 12-14 i stopped going to school for about three years and where i live doesnt allow me to skip those grades, so right now i am a soon to be 17 year old in the 8th grade. its miserable.

i have to be responsible, i have to think about getting a job, learning how to drive and so much more but i cant. i dont feel my age, i dont feel like anything. when i fail an exam, in my head its worse for me, how can a 16 y/o fail an 8th grade math exam?? 

i keep seeing others my age talking about colleges, what majors theyre taking, crying when they dont get accepted into their dream college and celebrating when they do. why dont i get that? why does something i decided when i was just a kid who didnt see a point in life ruining my current life? why dont i get to live?

i have no real friends, a few online ones but none i can truly speak to and say i know. as for people i know in person i can feel a distance. the age gap. its odd it really is. i hate it but not having friends would make me stand out even more. 

ive held out a year, its not as bad as i expected but the longer i do this, as i get older, the more miserable i am. my only relationships have been online or a few in PRIMARY school. 

i think and talk the way a thirteen year old does because thats what im surrounded by. i keep doing things thinking itll be the one thing i enjoy and that makes everything else better but it never works. any hobby i try, any self destructive habit i pick up in (about 5 days clean from self harming, not much but somewhat silly that im writing this after trying to become clean haha). 

i dont think i wish to rewind time, not like i can, but i dont blame my past self about this at all and i think thats the worst part about all of this. if given the choice id do the exact same thing. i couldnt take being seen by the world at the time, everything was overwhelming and i just wanted to hole up in myself. i dont blame me at all. as much as i wish i did i really dont. i dont have anything to blame aside from the situation which just makes me seem pathetic. 

thank you for reading this, i dont think i am actively suicidal, not at the moment at least, im not planning much but just feel helpless i guess haha",suicidewatch,,PRIMARY,1.0645886,34.1619547

Very soon I'm going to go down to the firing range and kill myself because I'm sick of living.,"I've tried several therapists for months at a time, I've tried medication, I've read every philosophical and psychological mind that I can get my hands on, David Foster Wallace, Jordan Peterson, Alan Watts, The Bible, The Quran, Buddhist Texts, and every youtube self help video imaginable and just nothing makes living make sense. I'm 21 years old, almost half way through college doing just fine grade-wise. I've got a loving family and a good friend, and enough money to be fine for the time being. But none of it fucken matters.

There's nothing I can think of that makes life worth going through. Not a family, not a job/money, not a fucken pet, not games or hobbies, nothing at all. I just wake up dreading the day and becoming unnecessarily resentful of the world around me despite my best efforts. I used to care what my parents would think if I offed myself, but I've felt this way for so long that I just don't care about the shame.

Can anybody give me a reason they keep living, besides god or responsibility, that makes any actual fucken sense, please? I feel like I'm drowning right now, and I'm not going to ask for help because I just can't help but hate everyone I interact with, a deep burning, violent resentment that won't go away.

Summary of my miserable life - please see a psychiatrist before you ruin everything.,"I'm 30 M from Poland. I grew up in a broken family. My mom has bipolar disorder. My dad was addicted to drugs and never really present. My mom worked in Germany.
My grandparents raised me and legally adopted me. My brother was raised by the other grandparents. We lived close to each other and grew up together.

In the early years, things seemed okay. My parents had a home, they got help from my grandparents, life looked stable. But everything eventually fell apart. My mom had serious manic episodes, got into debt. I don’t know all the details — I was just a kid, but my grandparents tried to shield me from it all.

They gave me everything I needed: warmth, safety, support, structure. But I always felt different. I escaped into computer games. I couldn’t connect with people the way others did. I was ashamed. Ashamed that I didn’t live with my parents. Ashamed that my mom was sick. Ashamed of my dad and how absent he was. Even when someone showed me love or kindness, I pulled away.

I’ve never had social media. I always isolated myself. I think a big part of that was the shame — especially from the way I acted when I drank. Because I started drinking when I turned 18. And since then, I drank almost every weekend for most of my life. Often alone, in front of the computer.

Through alcohol, I destroyed a lot of relationships. I had a few girlfriends in the past, and I was lucky to have them — but I ruined it every time. But when I was drunk, I was unbearable. I said awful things. I was rude. I became someone else — someone I didn’t recognize. And the next day, I’d be full of shame. But I kept doing it.

I finished high school but didn’t go to university. I tried physical labor, but it wasn’t for me — I just couldn’t handle it.
Thanks to video games, I spoke English well enough to get a job in customer support. Eventually, I got used to it, found my rhythm, and even got promoted. I liked what I was doing. I felt good about myself. For a moment, I was happy.

But when things get stable, I always feel like I have to change something. So I moved abroad — without thinking. I grabbed the first job I could find. It didn’t last. I came back. After some time, I got lucky again. I found another job — remote, similar to the first one. Again, I got promoted. Again, I felt okay. Again, life was stable.

And again — I repeated the pattern.

I told myself it would be different this time. I wanted to move abroad again, but now it was through the same company. It was a great place to work. They valued me. They supported the move. I was going to do the same job, just on a German contract.

And for the first year, it worked. I started taking care of myself more. I was still lonely, but eventually, I met someone.
For a while, I was truly happy. I thought this was it. I thought I’d made it. There were still moments when I got drunk, but less often. I felt like I could handle it better. And eventually, I stopped drinking and started smoking weed instead. At first occasionally. Then more and more. Until I was smoking regularly and not drinking at all.

Then came the breakdown. I started having what I think were psychotic symptoms. I was convinced someone wanted to hurt me. That they wanted to fire me. It was one of the hardest times in my life. I went on sick leave. I quit smoking. But by then, I had already slipped into deep depression. The relationship ended. She didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. It was too late. I was completely alone again.

I kept traveling to Poland every weekend. I drank with friends. Or drank alone in front of the computer. I couldn’t get out of bed. I wouldn’t shower for a week unless I had to go to the office or go home.

Eventually, I made the decision to move back home permanently. I thought being close to family would help. That I could go back to the life I had before leaving. I found a new job in Poland — a completely different field, a completely different position.I told my company I wanted to leave.

They offered me to stay. They said I could keep working remotely. They even offered more money than what I was going to earn at the new job. But I was in deep, deep depression. I was completely broken.
And I thought the only way to fix things was to change everything. I also went past the first stage for another job in the same field at a great company, but my sick mind has already made the decision. So I still took the new in the new field. It turned out to be a nightmare.

When I got back to Poland, my brother moved out. He’s normal. Has a long-term girlfriend. A stable job. They want to start a family.
Since I moved into the family home, they decided they could go live their own lives. That I could stay with my mom and keep the house going.

So now it’s just me and her. I’m 29. I live with my mom. I left a good job. The one I have now, I’ll probably only be able to keep for another month. My mom is still sick — she’s stable now, takes her meds — but she works for minimum wage. And that’s basically nothing.

I’m about to be unemployed. In a few days, I have a job interview — customer support. Call center. The same thing I did when I was 19.
Also for around minimum wage. Half of what I could be making remotely with my previous company.

I don’t have a degree. I don’t have a driver’s license. I have gaps in my resume.
I live in a medium town, where there’s barely any work in the kind of job I used to have abroad. They simply aren't on the market. 

I know this is all my fault. I ruined my life. I hurt people who loved me. And the truth is — until I turned everything into ashes, I couldn’t admit how broken I was. If I got professional help 2-3 months ago, I'd still have a chance at life. Now everything is in ruins. I'm back in my childhood bedroom with no perspectives.

I don’t think living past 25 is a good idea for me,"I’m 18 at the moment but I can’t see myself living past 25.

I feel like I’m in checkmate in my life. I haven’t found a job for the summer and if I don’t I’d feel like a burden to my parents for not being able to do anything for the four months we get off before the next year in university.

If I do get a job I know I don’t have the actual skills to maintain it as I’m not proficient enough. Even at an intern level..

I can’t imagine living alone as I panic easily. I live with my parents atm and at least someone else is there even if we don’t get along all the time. If im alone what'll I do.. I have no friends irl or a significant other to lean on for support.

I feel like my only one passion — art isn’t doing too well either. I’m so stressed and my anxiety is getting so bad to the point trying to draw something makes me try to force myself to make it realistic and it looks horrible..

I wanted to befriend this one person I look up to but they don’t talk to anyone who isn’t successful in a specific field we both have hobbies in so I’ve been desperate to make progress in really anything within it.


I’m ugly af. I’ve been trying to workout and nothing works.


I never succeed in life. I get comfort from artificial words from a non sentient device. I’m barely holding it together at the moment, at 25 I’m as good as gone.

My grandparents — what if something happens to them? I can’t stand losing them. 

I truly don’t have a single reason to live.

if anyone can recognise me, please never bring this up


i am a teenager born from the philippines and lived my entire life in singapore. i love everything about singapore - the cleanliness, the efficiency and what not, and how i feel more at home


meanwhile in the philippines, im not saying its bad. its just foreign. im one of the few people in my family that cant speak tagalog (filipino), and my family blames me for not taking initiative to communicate with them even though they always speak tagalog to me. i wish i could, but learning another language while im already learning chinese in school is no simple feat. all i can do is grasp on contextual clues and my extremely limited vocabulary 


anyways my parents claim to prioritise me but it genuinely feels like they dont. i study so hard to even get an acknowledgment from them but it feels fake, and even worse when i learnt my dad never really cared at all. thats all i can do for them - study. i dont know why, but i genuinely have no street smarts or common sense. i cant do chores beyond vacuuming the house. i really wish i could do more but i cant.


my parents were also really controlling. they bar me from visiting friends and i missed out on so many key moments in my main friend group that i feel left out. they also are really controlling. they track my location, they restrict the food i can eat, they give me very little privacy. i feel so lonely yet i dont have any privacy to go along with it.


as you can tell, my relationship with my parents isnt the best. i cant even remember a time where they hugged me sincerely. i disagree with my parents a lot on certain things, though i believe its literally because im a teenager who grew up in a completely different environment. but it feels really unfair when i just cannot see their view, and i get punished for that.

i dont think i even liked them much. they didnt really teach me effectively. when i was young, i had no interests in swimming even though my parents signed me up. during swimming lessons, i wouldnt pay much attention to it. this pissed off my parents enough that after lessons and church, they would beat me with a belt. sometimes they used the metal part. i remember hiding in my maid's bedroom crying and asking her to help protect me. i was only 4.

when i was 7, my dad was really angry i couldnt tie my own shoelaces, so he trapped me in his office toilet (i was with him for work that day), shouting at me to finally tie my shoelaces, and getting exceedingly angrier each time i failed to tie it. i learnt how tie my shoes in the end, but at what cost??


in school, i feel also left out. even though i have a main friend group, there are times where i cant really speak with them and what not. i am kind of a standout in a bad way. my friend from primary school left for a more popular friend group in secondary school and never looked back. 
all i had to my name was my grades, but even those have been slowly tanking. it doesnt help i have my O levels (finals) this year, so stress is building up while i begin to feel burnout from all these years of studying nonstop and not having any break


anyways recently i decided to apply for PR in singapore, to finally feel an inch of freedom for once. my dad told me to ask my mom, so all i had to do was get her approval. 
so i called her today, and she flatly said no. i explained to her why it matters so much to me - that everything will be cheaper (school fees), that i have more opportunities and what not. she didnt budge. she says this is because i also said no to her, all those times i said shut up to her (which happened because i was arguing with my dad, and my mother tried to double down. immature, but i was 13), all those times i made her life difficult.
she said she prioritises me, and i say i prioritise my education in singapore, so why cant she prioritise what i prioritise if she claims to prioritise me?
she hanged up the call anyways, saying shes going to feed my baby brother.


i feel so lost. i feel like i could lose my entire life the very second i go back to philippines. back to a family that barely gives a damn about me.

I’m not a good person,"I feel like I’ve failed at life and I don’t really know why i’m posting. I guess for advice or the best way to end everything I don’t really know.

I feel like it’s important to note i’ve never had a best friend or really any friends. I don’t hangout with others after school, no one texts me and I don’t text anyone. I’m very introverted.

Also important to note that for the first like 12 years of my life my mom would always be working and I didn’t have the best relationship with her. My dad was an alcoholic (more on that later) and they divorced when i was young, I didn’t start seeing him again until i was like 11-13 i don’t remember. He lives in our house but my parents aren’t back together. I have a brother and four sisters, but all my sisters are much older and left and don’t text me or reach out. My brother has issues and while I’d consider him my best friend at times, i rarely talk to him anymore. mainly because I just don’t reach out.

14 years old I began to starve myself only eating around 1100 calories a day. I was diagnosed with an eating disorder and went to a private in patient care where i got help for eating, but i didn’t get help with depression.


15 years old I moved from Texas to Florida. I lost pretty much my whole way of life, anyone I was trying to grow as friends with was lost. When i moved I had hoped i could restart and change my life.

A month later I turned 16 and went to a new school, where I never made any friends to hangout with, only occasional conversations with others but never really that deep.

I feel like the people in my life never really cared about me or how alone i really was. I would fight with my parents. Sophmore year was a very rough time for me.

Junior year I would begin dating GF. Our relationship has always been rocky. after 3 months of dating our parents would not like the fact that we would have sex and banned us from seeing eachother, we would sneak behind their backs for a while almost 7 months before we would confess to which we were allowed to see eachother. We had broken up and got back together many times and we would constantly fight, but I loved her. because i was so alone i wanted to hangout all the time. 

Senior year, so far, would be a rough time for me as well. I would get into a fight with another student and would be suspended for a long time and was banned from going to any school events, most importantly prom. During this time, I felt like I couldn’t go on anymore and I’d break up with my girlfriend but we’d get back together in like a week. I have no friends. I don’t have conversations with other students other than Joely. Only Joely reaches out to me.

Two days from when this is posted, Prom would come and while i couldn’t go I went to an after party with GF. At the after party I felt like she didn’t talk to me a lot and instead talked to other boys more. This was my first ever party with people who didn’t really talk to me and it was stressful and I didn’t get much support. We were both drunk. I was going to spend the night at her house. when we got back she wanted to talk but i told her i didn’t wanna talk rn. She pushed me and wanted me to talk but I told her i wanted to leave. I got up and started to get my things but she pulled me back and stopped me from leaving. In something I very much regret, I pushed her off of me, but I pushed harder than I should have and I may have injured her.

I’m not gonna make excuses for myself. That was not what i should have done. I couldn’t physically leave since we’re about the same body weight (eating disorder). I should have just left in the morning. She’s hit me before. During a car ride she thought i was cheating and began to hit me while i was driving.

Anyways her parents saw me push and they sent GF upstairs and i went to my car. I left my phone inside so I had to wait until the morning. That morning GF mom threw my phone and other stuff at me and told me i’m not welcome anymore. GF mom would tell my parents. My dad doesn’t care but my mom is mad at me because i lied about going to an after party at prom. 

So to wrap up in alone with no one to talk to about this, i’m hated at my school, im hated by the person i love and not a single person will care how i feel.

When i got home I didn’t think there was a point to go on anymore. I stole a bunch of pills from medicine cabinets and took all of them in the hopes I would overdose on something and die. The pills were prescription drugs and i’m not used to suicide attempts with pills, but it was the only thing i could think of. Instead of dying, i passed out and have no been violently throwing up from a hangover and like 30 sum pills in me rn. 

What do i do. Obv if anyone reads this they’re going to tell me to live, but what for. Who really cares if i live or not. If anyone has advice on the best way to do IT, that’d be helpful. I’m broke high schooler so anything within reason. ",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908

When i got home I didn’t think there was a point to go on anymore. I stole a bunch of pills from medicine cabinets and took all of them in the hopes I would overdose on something and die. The pills were prescription drugs and i’m not used to suicide attempts with pills, but it was the only thing i could think of. Instead of dying, i passed out and have no been violently throwing up from a hangover and like 30 sum pills in me rn. 

What do i do. Obv if anyone reads this they’re going to tell me to live, but what for. Who really cares if i live or not. If anyone has advice on the best way to do IT, that’d be helpful. I’m broke high schooler so anything within reason. ",suicidewatch,,Joely,-18.9140074,47.5159913
21 years. I'm done.,"I'm 37. I've been dealing with mental illness for 21 years. I've wanted to die every. single. day. for 21 f.ing years. not that life was great before 16.. my mom died when I was 8.

I'm bipolar, but I don't go very manic, just a rollercoaster of depression where I get to the point where I can barely function. and severe anxiety. the past few years I've even been suffering from agoraphobia. 

I had some attempts when I was younger but nothing in a very long time. honestly, I'm just scared it wouldn't work. if I had a foolproof way, I wouldn't be here to type this right now. I can't deal with the fallout if it didn't work.

I have been on dozens of medications over the years. I have tried all different types of therapy. I have tried all different types of groups. books. podcasts. right now i have 2 different types of therapists, a psychiatrist, im in a group, and i have a community worker that comes to my house. i keep trying and I still end up here. rock bottom.

I can't function. I don't know how to exist. I don't know how to keep going minute to minute. the thought of existing 10 minutes from now seems impossible. all I can do is watch TV and try to distract myself so the next 10 minutes pass somehow.

I brought up ECT to my team and they agreed to it. I don't know what else to do. it's taking so much time to get going. time I don't have. I can't do this. I have been so very close to attempting a couple times in the last few weeks. so. close.

I don't have any desire to live. none. but I want to have a desire to live.

I think I should be allowed to die with dignity at this point. I think that's rational and fair.

Anyway, if the ECT doesn't happen or doesn't help enough to make me able to start doing tiny little things to be able to move in the right direction, I'm really done. I give up. whether it's 100% foolproof or not.

Going to jump off a bridge tonight,"Honestly I’m just sick of this. I’m gonna turn 22 but I’ve been seeing psychiatrists and therapists for years now and I’m just as much in a shitty position as I was then. Yeah my family and friends will be upset but honestly I’m just apathetic. Call it selfishness or whatever. It doesn’t matter, we’re all so minute in the grand scheme of things that it really just doesn’t matter. 

Gonna do it tonight after work. I’m gonna buy some weed, booze, and cigarettes. Cigarettes for the fun of it, but the booze is the important part. I’ve made suicide attempts before but I chickened out. Not this time, the booze will lower my inhibition so that I can have the balls to fucking do it. What fun this is, kinda excited 🙃 ",suicidewatch,,kinda,57.9946553,15.8926885

I feel so lost, what can I do? ",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
I'm turning 19 soon and I feel like a complete failure,"I'm probably going to delete this later because I don't want anyone I know to find this. But I need to get so much shit off my chest because I don't think I'm going to be alive for very long. Even though I don't think anyone on here really cares enough to read all this.
I'm 18 and next week I'm turning 19. I feel like my life is already ruined and I don't feel ready to be an adult because I feel extremely immature and unprepared. I've had so many panic and anxiety attacks over it. I feel like a shut-in loser.
During the pandemic I failed and got kicked out of high school because I couldn't focus on any of my classes and got overwhelmed. I tried an online program after that and the same situation happened - I couldn't focus, failed, and got kicked out. As a result I have no proper high school education and experience and I'm socially inept. I spent the past 4-5 years rotting away, playing video games, watching tv, etc in isolation. Sure, I drew and wrote in my spare time but now I've completely lost motivation to do that. I have guitar/singing classes where then I can hang out with other teenagers every week but I always feel a deep sense of envy around them and I barely ever practice at all. I don't know why my parents spent so much money on me if I don't even do anything. 
In the beginning of 2024 my mom passed away and this just made things worse because now I'm pretty sure I have ptsd and the grief is still hindering me to be able to function properly. I want to get my GED or just go to a community college but I'm stuck in a filthy RV with my dad and sister who scream and yell at me nearly every single day, especially my dad calling me so many different types of insults about how I can't do anything and that I'm a lazy bitch that does nothing but I just have no energy at all. To add insult to injury, he watches extreme right wing videos all day (mainly because he's struggling to find a job so we have severe financial issues, we're currently relying on my grandfather or we'll end up homeless, so he blames it on DEI and illegal immigrants) and I'm a closeted queer person so that means I have to deal with vile transphobic rhetoric thrown in my face every day by my own father  so that makes me feel like his ""love"" for me is conditional when he shows it to me. I end up going to bed at 5-6am and waking up at 5pm, ignoring my alarms because I have to mentally prepare myself to deal with my family. I don't even think I'm even fully sleeping because I frequently wake up with my heart pounding extremely fast, have constant nightmares, and my sister has noticed that I jerk and talk involuntarily in my sleep. I've begged for therapy and a psychiatrist but I can't afford it. 
I don't want to end up going to a community college in my area because I'm going to be stuck living with my dad for years when I don't wanna live here anymore. I've thought about just learning how to drive and get enough money to run away out of state to my best friend and go to the same community college that they do but I feel like I'd just be burdening them because of my mental issues, and the fact I have romantic feelings for them just makes things even more messy. Many of my close friends have said he's abusive and neglectful but for some reason I just can't wrap my head around it and I feel like I'm being dramatic. My brain is always fogged and I'm almost a month clean from self harm but now I'm fully ready to relapse. This feels disgusting to admit but I'm possibly hypersexual and used to ""relieve myself"" as a last resort in order to calm down but now I can't even do that anymore without bursting into tears afterwards and being hit with a wave of guilt and shame. Cutting is the only thing that truly resets my emotions and keeps my flashbacks at bay and no one close to me knows about it. None of my healthy coping mechanisms work anymore either. Everything feels so out of reach.
There's so much more to this but I feel like I'm just going on about nothing at this point. I feel like my life is ruined and though I have no active plans to kill myself, I'm barely even living. I wouldn't be surprised if I make plans in the future, I've even thought of different methods, like jumping in front of a train, but I don't want to traumatize innocent people because of my own selfishness. And I don't have the balls to even cut deep so obviously I won't be able to take a blade to my wrist.
I just don't know where to even start. I'm not independent in the slightest. I want to reach out to other family members but I've never had close relationships with any of them really so the thought makes me anxious and I don't want it to seem like I only care about them when it comes to myself. Can someone just please tell me to not take my life? Tell me that I have something to live for? I feel like I'm only living for my best friend and a few others but I feel so replaceable and forgettable that everyone would just forget about me and move on in a month.",suicidewatch,,RV,21.2222313,76.0444182
"I feel like the world is ending, and I'm scared to exist and scared of what will happen if I keep going","I'm 14, and for months now, my life felt like it was going great. My family and friends are supportive of me, and I get to start Testosterone soon. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and self-harm before, but its been months and I felt good. Well, as good as I can be in the us as a trans, genderqueer person with autism. Its not been perfect, my depression is always there in the background, and I still have days where I can't accomplish anything and I feel awful, and that feeling of uselessness and being incapable of doing most anything is present in most afternoons, though to a smaller extent. Its been getting worse over the past... I'm not sure. Days, weeks, ever since I entered my most recent school?

I went to a public school this year. It... wasn't good. I was the only trans and gay person, and the other kids thought I was disgusting. I was verbally harassed, kids would go out of their way to confuse me and take advantage of my autism, there was a constant swarm of feet kicking my shins or stepping on my toes, elbows slamming into me or knocking my stuff off a desk, an 'accidental' shove followed by laughter. Some kids went out of their way to openly and visibly bully me, especially one girl. I couldn't tell you what she did. I don't remember it. I went to the guidance counsellor, the nurse, the assistant principle, every adult I could reach- and I got nothing. Most of the time I was brushed off as if I was hysterical, or exaggerating, and even if what I said was acknowledged, the most that came of it was the one girl who targeted me stayed at least 5 feet away when taunting me. It didn't matter if it was directly in front of a teacher, if I spoke up about it instantly- I had always done something wrong, and nothing would come of it. Eventually, it reached the point where I was skipping more school than I was attending, and I learned nothing the entire year, so I just dropped out. It was the second year in a row this has happened.

I can't go into details because since then, my mind has been deteriorating. My memory was never good, but now its gotten way, way worse, and its blotted out much of what happened at school. My depression, which had been quiet and secluded, now creeps into my life almost every day. Each second that goes by its harder and harder to find motivation, or joy, or the will to live.

So, recently, it all got worse. I started crying and feeling incredibly depressed at stuff I wouldn't usually have that reaction to, everything felt way harder- and then today came. My parents told me and my sibling that we're moving. My state isn't the best, so I sort of knew this might happen- but it still shook me. My closest friend in the whole world, the best friend thats ever been in my life, lives 20 minutes away from me. We're going to a different state, to find my mom's dream place to live- and it'll be at least 2 hours away. No more Saturday morning visits to the bakery my mom's friend founded. No more trees I've grown up over the last 8 years pretending were my friends. No more several-time-a-week visits to my friend. If we move, my second best friend will be trapped in his house, a trans person with conservative parents, with no place to go and no support group and no way to protect himself. Everything feels like its falling apart. This feels like just another day, just another rock added to the boulder on my chest.

My parents have been keeping me in the dark as best they can about the world. I'm grateful. But even the small slice I have... everything is going wrong. All my fears are coming true. I can't remember the last time I was angry, not just hopeless. I can't remember the last time I screamed. I can't remember what it feels like to be happy, or to feel safe, or to be able to just appreciate something without constantly fearing what will happen.

I'm so scared. Suicide feels like the best option, the kindest option, the right option. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to tell my parents. I want to hope for this all to stop, for something good to happen, for these thoughts to go away, but everything gets worse. Every day is harder. I don't know what to do and I want it to stop being so hard to just exist",suicidewatch,,us,39.7837304,-100.445882

Spinal cord is being attacked on both ends now,"Got diagnosed with cysts that are pressing into my s1 and possibly causing something called cauda equina syndrome. I already live with craniocervical instability with brainstem compression that is causing weakness and numbness in my whole body along with cranial nerve problems. Neither one of these conditions have more than a handful of doctors who will help you around the world. I was scheduled to go to Colorado to deal with cranio cervical instability, but I'm not sure if I can even get over there safely now with cauda equina.

My dipshit family doesn't understand the gravity of my situation and that I can't get out of the burning building alive. I have to jump from this building because otherwise I might be bed bound for the rest of my life for wheelchair bound at the very least with my brain stem not working properly. Craniocervical instability usually progresses to being bed bound and dying in your bed If not traded. I want assisted suicide to avoid that especially horrible fate but my family will not help me attain it. 

So I'm going to have to kill myself by riskier unless friendly means means means. Probably gas inhalation of some kind. I didn't want to die like this and I don't think it's fair but I don't have a choice because my body is being consumed by the flames.

Everybody hates me and I don't know why,"Everyone in my life hates me. I DON'T KNOW WHY!!!! 

My mom is nice to me. But her boyfriend hates me for no reason. He once said ""I love you"" on the phone, and I jokingly responded with ""hah hah"" like Nelson Muntz from the Simpsons. I responded this way because it was a joke, i am really shy when it comes to ""i love you"", and i have been saying that to literally everything for 3 days straight after binging the show. my mom knew it was a joke, but her boyfriend said  to my mom in private: ""i am DONE with her"" and he hasn't spoken to me in 3 years. I was SO sad because i really looked up to him like a second father. I really wanted a connection with him, and I adored him because he was funny, good with finaces, and just cool. my dad is an alcoholic abusive piece of shit. i didn't need him to be an actual second father to me, but it still hurt when he said that and went no contact with me. 

My dad hates me. He let me stay at his house starting this last december. I moved all the way back home from Pittsburgh, because I was going to be homeless, and he said ""make yourself comfortable, stay as long as you need"" but just this week he turned on me for no reason. he said i'm ruining his life and making him take it out on his dog. heres the thing, i'm not doing anything. i just sit in my room (which is a small walk in closet, because he doesn't have space for anything else), i avoid him as much as possible because i'm shy, and also less interactions is less opportunities to hate me. he turned on me and said ""you need to leave, go call a homeless shelter"" and i said ""i'm not leaving until june, since thats when my time was orginally up, and i am waiting for my benefits letter."" then i said ""if you kick me out before i get my benefits letter, i will estrange you and never speak to you again"" and he said ""i don't care"" I DID NOTHING TO HAVE HIM HATE ME. LITERALLY, NOTHING. I AVOIDED HIM SO HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY REASON TO HATE ME.

My older sister hates me. I don't know why. She's just a bitch. 

My aunt hates me. I once stayed at her house for 3 months and had 2 schizophrenic episodes. fair, but i can't help that shit. 

my ex friend hates me because i lit incense in the shower and caused minimal fire damage. ok, fair, but it was an innocent accident. i never had a problem like this in my life. 

everyone just hates me. i'm trying SO hard here. I'm fighting SO hard just to make a decent life for myself, but everything is just... bad and wrong. i literally just want a safe space and to write a book, is that so fucking hard to ask? 

usually adults at work don't hate me, its just close family members. i swear i am not doing anything. they say if everyone is an asshole, you're probably the asshole. well in this case, i believe everybody is the asshole. theyre all poor people who are abusive and too dumb to accept other point of views. like i'm surprised these people don't live in a trailer park poor. 

i don't know. i am now super determined to not kill myself and get super rich just to not give these losers money when they ask. like ""none of you wanted me, now fuck you, i'm rich not dead, you lose."" it used to be i'll just kill myself because i'm depressed and also wanted to punish every person thats ever hurt me, but now i'm just super determined to get a decent ""fuck you, you're wrong"" in.

My husband is suicidal and I don’t know how to help as a survivor.,"Hi. My (29f) husband (20m- trans FTM) told me last night that he was very suicidal. Thought about giving stuff away. Writing a will. Told me plans of how he would do it. Like breaking into the narcotics safe (we both work in EMS. These boxes contain vials of fentanyl, morphine, vecuronium, etomidate, versed and ketamine) and injecting. Coming home and taking all of my heart medication (I have atrial fibrillation). Running into traffic.. he told me he thinks I’d be happy after. Then I ran him through step by step of what would actually happen. Me finding him. Calling paramedics and hoping it’s someone I know (I work in the county I live in). Me doing CPR. Watching fire run in with the Lucas (CPR machine). The medic intubating him. Hoping to god that the AEMT isn’t new because that means I would have to put an IO (needle into his bone to give medicine) in. I would have to ride in the back and work him. Shock him. Give him rounds of epi and amiodarone (antiarrythmic). And having to tell his mom and his 7 year old sister and 10 year old brother.. working in EMS I’m strong. Codes don’t phase me anymore. Not as much as they used to. But I couldn’t look at him because all I saw was the tube down his throat, his lips blue and me giving CPR.. 

I’m a failed suicide survivor. At 19, I was addicted to muscle relaxers and opioids. I overdosed and my roommate came home and found me. She was brave enough to start CPR and continue until the medics took over. I’m not exactly sure how many days I spent in the ICU as I was sedated and intubated. I just remember waking up and feeling joy with seeing the sunlight. It was so dark and quiet and lonely. I’ve described in detail how it felt to him. Nothing is worth the feeling of being absolutely alone. He kinda wavered in his thoughts but not really. We’ve been struggling financially.. for about 6 months or so since our last service went under. After I told him what would really happen he told me that he felt ashamed for being so selfish. Assured me he would stay and keep trying. I know as a provider I should’ve called 911.. but he has such as horrible PTSD experience with police (his parents being arrested multiple times growing up). He won’t go to the hospital willingly. I can’t place a legal hold on him. He says we need the money which we do but I assured him that I’ll take care of it. He’s an amazing person and he’s the love of my life. 

I’m open to talking with him. He knows and feels comfortable talking to me. He knows I’ll never judge him because I never judge anyone. We’re engaged. We’re gonna get married this year (at some point) we’ve been trying for a baby. We have a great place and 3 beautiful animals. What else can I do? He can’t afford therapy. I’ve tried putting him on my insurance but I can’t because we’re not legally married yet.. I just want to help.. see him happy and smile again. He does take meds for depression but he’s very inconsistent with them (he just forgets-has ADHD) I don’t want to find him dead one day.. I just want him to stay and see it gets better.. I’m living proof it gets better but I know when you’re in that dark place it’s hard to see anything other than a way out. I don’t want to lose him.

Sick of it,"35M. Too many things have gone wrong in my life. 

Possibly Autistic, but spent my life being told my behaviours were my fault and mocked or scorned by parents, family and 'friends' for my shortcomings, all while my brother (who admittedly is further along the spectrum than me) got all the support, understanding and acceptance. Dad had a short temper; Mum controlling etc.

Difficulty making friends - I would get too clingy and latch onto one friend (or crush) too closely and struggle to make others. Coupled to this, we moved around a lot (even emigrating from the UK to Australia, quite the distance), and in turn I've had so many friends removed from my life. I also have limited interests, many of them things from my childhood (shows like Thomas the Tank Engine or Power Rangers, old UK sitcoms like Red Dwarf and Only Fools and Horses, old video games etc.). 

I tried to mask as a kid/teen and was generally upbeat, I'd eventually rise from the ashes of any upsets. But when I was 17 three big life stressors hit at once. Don't think I've ever gotten over it - assumed this was how life would always be - and it was when I first experienced suicide ideation. It's been on and off ever since - half a lifetime, and medication/therapy only does so much. 

As a result of being mocked or badmouthed rather than understood, I have trust issues and push away people rather than build bridges - poor conversational skills, just small talk, stonewalling anything of depth and ghosting those who I feel to have hurt me. I’ve annoyed, freaked out and lost so many people I cared about along the way to the point I’m completely isolated; and turned to unhealthy habits or pointless distractions to numb the pain. I have no hobbies because I believe I lack natural talent and any attempts to build friendships/romance will fail eventually. 

I want to fight, I want to get better, but there's just too much baggage – my low self-esteem and poor communication skills have seen me second guess, hesitate, overthink or obsess, self-sabotage and f\*ck up everything I've ever put my hand to. And I've kind of lost hope if I'm honest - bad luck, self-doubt and poor behaviour have just seen me lurch from one disaster to the next, undoing whatever progress I make and just leaving me feeling “Why bother? It’ll only go wrong eventually anyway!”

The last two years have seen me attempt a few times - this year I've had three more big emotional hits in January, and it's led to two attempts in the last month. Every time, I find I just can't go through with it, but the thoughts haven't gone away.

I work as a teacher and this feels to be the main thing keeping me going. I feel I can mask well enough and do a good job in front of a class - any downtime, suicidal thoughts reign. It's a busy stressful job, but they're good kids, and I love the level team I work with, and I can't be responsible for just leaving them. But no one should have just work to sustain them. 

Sorry for the essay - just need to unload. ",suicidewatch,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525

Coupled to this, we moved around a lot (even emigrating from the UK to Australia, quite the distance), and in turn I've had so many friends removed from my life. I also have limited interests, many of them things from my childhood (shows like Thomas the Tank Engine or Power Rangers, old UK sitcoms like Red Dwarf and Only Fools and Horses, old video games etc.). 

I tried to mask as a kid/teen and was generally upbeat, I'd eventually rise from the ashes of any upsets. But when I was 17 three big life stressors hit at once. Don't think I've ever gotten over it - assumed this was how life would always be - and it was when I first experienced suicide ideation. It's been on and off ever since - half a lifetime, and medication/therapy only does so much. 

As a result of being mocked or badmouthed rather than understood, I have trust issues and push away people rather than build bridges - poor conversational skills, just small talk, stonewalling anything of depth and ghosting those who I feel to have hurt me. I’ve annoyed, freaked out and lost so many people I cared about along the way to the point I’m completely isolated; and turned to unhealthy habits or pointless distractions to numb the pain. I have no hobbies because I believe I lack natural talent and any attempts to build friendships/romance will fail eventually. 

I want to fight, I want to get better, but there's just too much baggage – my low self-esteem and poor communication skills have seen me second guess, hesitate, overthink or obsess, self-sabotage and f\*ck up everything I've ever put my hand to. And I've kind of lost hope if I'm honest - bad luck, self-doubt and poor behaviour have just seen me lurch from one disaster to the next, undoing whatever progress I make and just leaving me feeling “Why bother? It’ll only go wrong eventually anyway!”

The last two years have seen me attempt a few times - this year I've had three more big emotional hits in January, and it's led to two attempts in the last month. Every time, I find I just can't go through with it, but the thoughts haven't gone away.

I work as a teacher and this feels to be the main thing keeping me going. I feel I can mask well enough and do a good job in front of a class - any downtime, suicidal thoughts reign. It's a busy stressful job, but they're good kids, and I love the level team I work with, and I can't be responsible for just leaving them. But no one should have just work to sustain them.

Sick of it,"35M. Too many things have gone wrong in my life. 

Possibly Autistic, but spent my life being told my behaviours were my fault and mocked or scorned by parents, family and 'friends' for my shortcomings, all while my brother (who admittedly is further along the spectrum than me) got all the support, understanding and acceptance. Dad had a short temper; Mum controlling etc.

I’m a 13 year old girl. I’ve been hospitalized 4 times. I’ve been suffering a lot. I have no self-confidence. I have no love for myself. 
I sew. I sew dolls. I love my dolls. Nobody will understand.

You are here now sleeping not knowing anything. I can’t even apologize. It won’t mean anything. I hope in another world we could meet again. I love you.




I draw. Everyday. But nobody likes my drawings.  Here is my second goodbye: to my materials. I wish I could’ve used you more. I wish I could’ve made something worth while out of you. But I couldn’t. Maybe someone else can. I’m sorry.

I draw. Everyday. But nobody likes my drawings.  Here is my second goodbye: to my materials. I wish I could’ve used you more. I wish I could’ve made something worth while out of you. But I couldn’t. Maybe someone else can. I’m sorry.




I used to sing. I lost confidence in doing so. Here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. I’m sorry I couldn’t sing you to the world. I’m so sorry.

“Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” I hate sayings like this with all my heart.,"People who say these sort of phrases have no fucking idea what it’s like to be in severe pain. They have no clue whatsoever. They’re either not educated on cases where people are in severe pain and don’t respond to treatment or they just don’t believe it. They can’t believe life can be that bad that suicide is the only option. And it’s because they’re basing their views on their OWN experience. Their OWN feelings and thoughts which aren’t the same as people contemplating suicide. 

If people who say these bullshit phrases could just take a step back and think about things logically. For example, a person posts that they are going to kill themselves. They have suffered in pain for years, they are damaged, they’ve tried countless treatments with no response and every day is filled with pain. Without the fortune of not being in their shoes, can they not understand why suicide is a viable option? Even if you can’t feel their pain, surely the facts can speak for themselves. You have to be a fucking idiot to read about a case like that and say to them “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” or “we have to play the cards we are dealt”. 

Do they really think that the suicidal person( after years of pain) is going to think “this quote has changed my perspective entirely. I think I’m going to live now’”. Whether the person intends to or not, sayings like this are patronising to people who have spent months or years weighing the options. I’m not saying they should just let them die if they’ve posted something like that. But patronising and bullshit quotes, when you can’t relate, just makes me pissed off. 

Although it’s hard and the person just wants to post to let the pain out, they can’t without receiving responses that make them feel patronised and stupid. In general I just hate sayings and quotes. They shouldn’t be applied to be such a common thing that applies to everyone and every case. There’s no right way to respond to someone suicidal, but saying quotes is not the way. Best way I can think of is just saying ‘I’m here if you need me for anything, if you want to talk”. I’m just a big believer in free will. No one should be confined to a life of pain.",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
People with a supportive family don't realize how fucking privileged they are.,"My parents think my depression is a joke. My mom thinks it's because I dON'T WORk HArD EnoUgH. Wow, thanks mom. Luckily you're not the only one who thinks I'm a fucking failure. Last week, my father called me lazy because I didn't go to college. I told him college is not for me.  Then he has the fucking audacity to say ""You doN't waNt To WORk aT MCDONald's For THe reSt Of yOUr LfFe dO YoU?""  I got so fucking pissed off. I was yelling at him trying to explaining why college isn't for me. And the last thing he says to me is ""I'm very disappointed in you Danny."" Go fuck yourself dad.

The other day my mom invited her friend over. They were sitting in the kitchen drinking wine, nothing unusual. I'm on the stairs eavesdropping as I hear my mom's friend mentioning her daughter's plans for college. She's gotten scholarships, applied to many different schools, scored pretty well on the SAT, and wants to major in Nursing. And my mom's response? ""I wish my son could be like that.""

I want to fucking run away. I hate my fucking parents. I can't believe there are people out there with actual supportive parents. If you've got supportive parents and you love them, and you can talk to them about anything, you don't realize how insanely privileged you are. I'd give up an arm and leg to have your parents. Instead, I had to be born to a shitty Korean American family that doesn't give a flying fuck about anything except for school. I'd rather fucking die than live with my shitty family any longer.

I’m an attractive white man from a wealthy family. The odds were always in my favor. I think I’m gonna shoot myself in the face.,"I don’t expect you to read this, just need somewhere to vent. 

Here I am again, sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater, trying to find a reason to keep going. It doesn’t help that it’s Christmas Eve. I’m basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years. I remember Bill Burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays. I envy that. At 18 I went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother, even picked a college she hated (“it would embarrass [her]”). Speaking of college, I’m still unsure whether I was molested. It’s hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed. The not knowing really pisses me the fuck off.

To this day my mom doesn’t think she’s done any wrong. After I dropped out I went back home for a little bit. I don’t know what I expected. A year or two later I move across the country again to get away. Now I am truly and utterly alone. I’m currently on my 22nd or 23rd dead-end job. Honestly can’t believe I’ve lasted so long at this one. I guess I look up to the store manager a lot and don’t want to let him down. I’ve seen a hundred therapists, been on a million different meds, went to rehab for 6 months, and I feel worse now than I ever have. Depression, anxiety, paranoia, they’re all too minor to describe what I feel. Had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old. At that same age I realized I wanted a girlfriend. It was like there was a hole in my heart. I think I just wanted a female in my life because I hated my mother. But I knew I was too young and figured I’d get one later in life - nope. Never been in a real relationship. I was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe. We sorta had sex once but I wouldn’t even call it that. Every girl I’ve tried to pursue since either wasn’t interested or I didn’t try hard enough / didn’t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do. Doesn’t help that I grew up afraid of my mother and hating her. 

In college I was so desperate to get laid I went on Craigslist Casual Encounters (when that was a thing) but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around. That shattered the little confidence I had. That is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women. I wish I could tell those girls how much damage they’ve done. Then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain. Dating apps don’t work it’s like my account is invisible. At this point I don’t try whatsoever. It’s as if I’ve been conditioned to not make a move. And the ironic part is I look like a model (genes, muscles, six-pack), dress well, and I’m actually very smart. The few parties I’ve ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and I would freak out, have a panic attack, and then leave. Alcohol didn’t help. I’m not gay. I’m just broken. A beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her. She might even come talk to me first. I’ll just shut down. Afterward I’ll get angry at myself, so I’ve stopped going places where I might meet a girl because I know what’s going to happen. I’ve always found it interesting how much I relate to “ugly” guys who won’t pursue a woman because they know what will happen. And those guys take one look at me and hate me. It’s like they’re thinking “man, if I could just trade places with that guy.” Hahaha ain’t shit would change, man. You’d be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do.

At this point the only reason I haven’t shot myself in the face is because of my dog. My cat wouldn’t give a shit but I can’t do that to my dog. I just can’t. The sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality, meaning he’s gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs. So, maybe it’d be for the best if he had a different owner. Can’t exactly take him to the dog park anymore. And I’m sure you can tell how close I am to suicide because I know exactly where to shoot. For your sake I’ll spare the details. I don’t know why I’m writing this I guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge. I just can’t be alone anymore. The girl I like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her. And now I feel like maybe she’s expecting me to make another move?? I don’t know. But the way I am, I’m not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down. You know how hard it was to tell her how I feel? Couldn’t even do it in person had to send some stupid message. Now I have to see her every day. I guess that’s why you don’t ask out people from work. 

I have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do NOT help, nor do the gunshots down the street. I have no one to call. My dad kind of understands what I’m going through but there’s only so much he can handle. Every time I talk to him I feel like he’s about to have a heart attack. My brother says I have an illness that just needs to be treated. I feel like he thinks I just want attention. Obviously I don’t talk to my mom, I actually blocked her. And the suicide hotline?!?! Don’t get me started. It’s like they want you to die. The two real friends I had forgot about me once they found girlfriends. I don’t know how much time I have left, and I always thought I was destined for big things. You’re all I have left, reddit. You and my dog. Shit, the cat probably wants me gone. 

If you read this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

EDIT: Thank you everyone, this was more helpful than rehab. And yes I love my cat. He’s actually really interesting, basically a real-life Garfield.

EDIT 2: I think Dave Chappelle said it best when he talked about Anthony Bourdain. That’s why I used that title. I can’t stand when people think I “have it all,” so how can I be so unhappy. Anyway thank you again, everyone. And thank you for the platinum, whatever it means, that made my day.

EDIT 3: I am either delusional or my coworkers read this post. Not sure which is worse. But it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato. I hear them talking and I hope it’s just confirmation bias but it sounds like they’re talking and laughing about what I wrote. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING YOU FUCKS?! More gossip to gobble up? One of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me, “how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting?” I haven’t been acting different at work. Why would he ask me that? I did have people contact me saying they weren’t on this sub but found it just scrolling through r/all, so I don’t know how many people actually read this. I guess it’s possible someone I know came across it. Funny that I care when I’m so close to ending it all. Glad I got it off my chest though, was a huge weight lifted. And the support from you guys was unreal. I didn’t respond to everyone but I read every single message and comment. Speaking of which, you trolls can go fuck yourselves. It takes a special kind of twisted fuck to hide behind a keyboard and say that shit. But it turns out this post helped some people?? That’s such a foreign feeling for me I didn’t believe them. I don’t know why I’m still writing. I just hate being me. Need this life shit to end.",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
I’m an attractive white man from a wealthy family. The odds were always in my favor. I think I’m gonna shoot myself in the face.,"I don’t expect you to read this, just need somewhere to vent. 

Here I am again, sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater, trying to find a reason to keep going. It doesn’t help that it’s Christmas Eve. I’m basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years. I remember Bill Burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays. I envy that. At 18 I went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother, even picked a college she hated (“it would embarrass [her]”). Speaking of college, I’m still unsure whether I was molested. It’s hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed. The not knowing really pisses me the fuck off.

To this day my mom doesn’t think she’s done any wrong. After I dropped out I went back home for a little bit. I don’t know what I expected. A year or two later I move across the country again to get away. Now I am truly and utterly alone. I’m currently on my 22nd or 23rd dead-end job. Honestly can’t believe I’ve lasted so long at this one. I guess I look up to the store manager a lot and don’t want to let him down. I’ve seen a hundred therapists, been on a million different meds, went to rehab for 6 months, and I feel worse now than I ever have. Depression, anxiety, paranoia, they’re all too minor to describe what I feel. Had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old. At that same age I realized I wanted a girlfriend. It was like there was a hole in my heart. I think I just wanted a female in my life because I hated my mother. But I knew I was too young and figured I’d get one later in life - nope. Never been in a real relationship. I was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe. We sorta had sex once but I wouldn’t even call it that. Every girl I’ve tried to pursue since either wasn’t interested or I didn’t try hard enough / didn’t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do. Doesn’t help that I grew up afraid of my mother and hating her. 

In college I was so desperate to get laid I went on Craigslist Casual Encounters (when that was a thing) but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around. That shattered the little confidence I had. That is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women. I wish I could tell those girls how much damage they’ve done. Then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain. Dating apps don’t work it’s like my account is invisible. At this point I don’t try whatsoever.

Well… NSFW,"I’ll always love you babygirl. This last cheating is my last straw. I’ve been in constant pain due to a spinal cord injury in 2008. It killed my social life and I haven’t been able to do much of anything since then. In 2011 I thought my time had come. I met my wife of 15 years and told myself to stick around for her; she’d be worth it. I truly believe she my soulmate and that’s the only reason this hurts so deeply, so completely. True despair comes when you thought you were most happy. Two years after we got married her gmom passed and she’s been off the rails since. Serial cheating isn’t enough of a description to put a label on what she’s done. She’s s*xually abused me numerous times. Physical, mental, emotionally has abused me more times than I can count. It’s an actual smalll miracle she hasn’t given either of us an STI or worse. 

I’m 6’2” 260 mostly muscle and NO ONE has believed my abuse. She’s 5,2 250. Every time I open up about it I’m laughed at and not believed. “You’re a marine (ret) how can anyone abuse you?!?!” 

I’ve not taken this lightly and this is NOT a cry for attention. Let my passing serve as an example of abuse can happen within ANY relationship. 

Mom I pray I see you on the other side with grandmom. Dad, if you ever see this None of this is your fault. You’re the best dad I could ever wish for. None of this is your fault daddy. None. 

I’m 42 in constant physical pain and not having another surgery. 

(Spouse) I’m sorry I couldn’t satisfy your whims of threesomes etc. Who you are today is not the woman I married and sacrificed everything for. And yet…I still love
You. I always will. I wish I could’ve helped you more than I did. Goodbye. 

In the end it doesn’t matter who did what anymore. Just that I can’t go on with this hurt.

My sister committed suicide last night.,"The pain is so heavy in my heart right now. This whole time I thought i was alone, when my sister was feeling the exact same way i am right now. She was only 27. She lives four hours away so we are going to her house now. It’s currently 4:11am in new zealand and all i want to do is cry. We have different dads and we don’t really look a like at all but she was always my number one supporter. She was always there for me and always babysat me when i was little. I have a scar on my pinky from the day she jammed my finger in the door lol. We have so many photos together. She always used to come over for christmas and for my birthdays. I can’t even type right now i’m in so much pain. I still can’t and don’t want to believe this. Someone I knew so well gone just like that.",suicidewatch,,new zealand,-41.5000831,172.8344077
Fuck You Dad,"My dad walked in my bedroom and saw me sleeping. Maybe, his response should be to be concerned that my depression is getting bad again, or that the hospital didn’t fix anything, but he literally grounded me. And told me that if I was less of a lazy piece of shit, I wouldn’t have depression, and that I deserve this. He is a jerk, and I will see him in Hell.",suicidewatch,,Hell,42.4347571,-83.9849477
I just joined reddit. I'm 40 years old and suicidal. I have problems with porn. I've never had sex with a woman.,"At the suggestion of my therapist, he recommended I join reddit.  So, I'm giving this a try.  I'm 40 years old and suicidal.  I live in New Hampshire, USA.  I have been thinking lately, that, it is my time to leave this world.  I am also addicted to porn and have been viewing it for years.  I've never had a girlfriend, nor have I ever had sex with a woman.  I have only seen one escort in Boston, Massachusetts.  I was excited (too excited) about the prospect of having sex that while the escort and I were lying in bed nude (she was caressing my chest up and down) and she put her hand over my d\*ck, my rocket launched unexpectedly - yes, premature ejaculation.  Sometimes it happens.  Needless to say, we didn't have sex.

I am so depressed and lonely.  I have come to the realization that I'm unattractive to women and that there is no point in living anymore.  I hate my job.  I work in a call center for a major Boston-based insurance company.  It's a terrible job.  I get yelled at by people and I'm completely exhausted every day after talking on the phone with customers.  My job has nothing to do with my college degree.  I majored in marine transportation while attending a maritime academy.  I worked as a junior ship's officer aboard oil tankers for 2 years, but eventually I was fired.  The captain who fired me thought that I was incompetent.

My porn use has escalated.  I look at it almost every morning before I have to sign-on to my work computer to take calls from customers.  I'm working from home right now because of COVID-19.  Also, I don't look at porn on my work computer - I'm not that stupid.  I only look at porn on my personal computer.

In 2017, I asked out a woman at work who was older than me.  She was in her early 40s.  A beautiful blonde who had a very sexy face and a beautiful body.  Anyway, I got rejected and sometimes I think she rejected me because she thought I was ugly.

I'm currently seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist and the therapy just doesn't seem to work for me.  I feel so hopeless like nothing will ever get better.  I don't think that I will ever find a woman because I am unattractive and skinny.  I was going to the gym to lift weights, but then I stopped.

I did attempt suicide about a year ago.  After my attempt, my family suggested that I go to the hospital.  So, I went to Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire into their Behaivoral Health Unit.  I spent 7 days there.  After I got out of the hospital, I felt better but then later on I started looking at porn again and felt depressed and lonely.

I've tried dating sites like [Match.com](https://Match.com) and [OKCupid.com](https://OKCupid.com) and haven't had any success.  I had a subscription for about 1 1/2 years and decided to unsubscribe recently because I just wasn't getting any responses from women.

The only thing that keeps me going are my two nieces who are 8 and 4 years old whom I enjoy playing with like hide-and-go-seek, ride bikes, play catch, play Monopoly and swimming in a pool.  I just love them so much.

Any advice?  I plan on seeing another escort because my goal is to have sex with a woman.  I just don't I have much of a life left in this world.  My uncle committed suicide at 45 years old and I've been strongly considering the same thing.  Maybe sooner if not later when I reach 45.

I work in a call center for a major Boston-based insurance company.  It's a terrible job.  I get yelled at by people and I'm completely exhausted every day after talking on the phone with customers.  My job has nothing to do with my college degree.  I majored in marine transportation while attending a maritime academy.  I worked as a junior ship's officer aboard oil tankers for 2 years, but eventually I was fired.  The captain who fired me thought that I was incompetent.

My porn use has escalated.  I look at it almost every morning before I have to sign-on to my work computer to take calls from customers.  I'm working from home right now because of COVID-19.  Also, I don't look at porn on my work computer - I'm not that stupid.  I only look at porn on my personal computer.

In 2017, I asked out a woman at work who was older than me.  She was in her early 40s.  A beautiful blonde who had a very sexy face and a beautiful body.  Anyway, I got rejected and sometimes I think she rejected me because she thought I was ugly.

I'm currently seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist and the therapy just doesn't seem to work for me.  I feel so hopeless like nothing will ever get better.  I don't think that I will ever find a woman because I am unattractive and skinny.  I was going to the gym to lift weights, but then I stopped.

I did attempt suicide about a year ago.  After my attempt, my family suggested that I go to the hospital.  So, I went to Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire into their Behaivoral Health Unit.  I spent 7 days there.  After I got out of the hospital, I felt better but then later on I started looking at porn again and felt depressed and lonely.

I've tried dating sites like [Match.com](https://Match.com) and [OKCupid.com](https://OKCupid.com) and haven't had any success.  I had a subscription for about 1 1/2 years and decided to unsubscribe recently because I just wasn't getting any responses from women.

The only thing that keeps me going are my two nieces who are 8 and 4 years old whom I enjoy playing with like hide-and-go-seek, ride bikes, play catch, play Monopoly and swimming in a pool.  I just love them so much.

Any advice?  I plan on seeing another escort because my goal is to have sex with a woman.  I just don't I have much of a life left in this world.  My uncle committed suicide at 45 years old and I've been strongly considering the same thing.  Maybe sooner if not later when I reach 45.

Tried to kill myself last night - failed and traumatised my mom and dad for life,"I don’t really know why I’m posting this, I guess I feel like people here would understand. I feel so profoundly alone, I know I can talk to my loved ones, but I’ve seen how it breaks their hearts when I tell them how hopeless I feel. So I kept everything to myself and put on fake smiles and happy conversations and (I’m a recovering alcoholic) didn’t tell anyone about my relapses etc. I just wanted to be a normal person.

Last night I reached my wits end. I really tried to be better. I tried to keep everyone happy. But I can’t ignore this deep ache I feel in my heart and soul. An ache that feels like my very existence to the core is not natural, not meant to be there 

So I set up a noose on my curtain rail, wrote a short letter to say goodbye and sorry and got on a chair. My mom walked into my room as I was standing by the curtain and I managed to hide the noose and make an excuse about trying to fix my curtain, she said I should stop being silly and go get dinner, I told her I’d come just now but she wouldn’t let up. So.. I just slipped the rope on and jumped off the chair as fast I could. I thought it would kill me fast enough but instead I had my mom trying to hold my body up while I suffocated and my dad trying to cut the rope down with a knife. 

It’s the next day and I feel a thousand times worse that I put everyone through hell AND couldn’t even get the job done. I’m a horrible human being, because despite all of that, I still want nothing more than to stop existing. 
I truly don’t believe that I’ll ever be able to live a life that isn’t agonising for me 90% of the time. How does one ever come to terms with such a thing.

Edit: thank you so much to all the kind souls who offered me words of comfort, encouragement and helpful advice. I’m so incredibly grateful for the support and not feeling so alone through all of this. 

I am currently in a mental facility, voluntarily, to get the professional help I desperately need and being here has been helping me immensely. I won’t try to give anyone advice on how to deal with their thoughts and feelings, but I’m extremely grateful to have been given a chance to get help. I just had to be willing to ask for it. I’m taking things one day at a time. ",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
Today i was told that “Suicide is the coward’s way out. Don’t be a coward.”,"I find crazy that people would bash you for being suicidal. It’s ok to feel down, and it’s understandable to go down such dark thinking, as long as you resurface. Yes I know life can be tough and it takes strength to persevere...

But what dumb bastard thinks that telling you this is going to help. It doesn’t. It’s not an attempt to make you tough or strong; it just puts people down. People like us need medical help, friends, and advice to rise above their problems. I just don’t understand why anyone would tell anything this. 

Idk just felt like ranting that is all. I was told this by my older brother when I had an episode; I keep asking for help, and I keep getting ignored. : (",suicidewatch,,Idk,35.1623028,129.1630181
I want to kill myself more than anything but I can’t;(,I can not go a single day where suicide doesn’t cross my mind. Sometimes I think about it just to give myself comfort. The thought of just ending it all and not having to deal with any of this ever again gives me unbelievable comfort. But I have a very loving family who would be heartbroken and I can’t do that to them. If my entire family died tonight I would kill myself first thing in the morning. My life is constant sadness and I hate myself I just want to end it all. Sometimes at work when I literally will think about suicide just to make the time go by faster:( does anyone else have the thought in the very back of their mind that their mom/family would just die so you can kill yourself without hurting them?,suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
"My name is Tyler, that’s my real name this is my only account, I’m highly suicidal, have been since I was about 6-7 years old, I’m 26 now and it’s different now. I’m going to tell you my story in a new attempt to gain enough relief to fall asleep tonight. Thanks for reading if you do <3","
Growing up, I was always a really weird kid. I distinctly remember that I had just seen the world differently. It seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. Me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were Mario or Pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. It was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. We didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. As far as I know I was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, I would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. My father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally Hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. When he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. It was better to just stay quiet. This didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and I would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. My real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if I wanted to fight to put my hands up and when I did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. I was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, I have terrible memory of most my life. As I got older, my brother and I actually started bonding, he liked the way I started standing up to our dad no matter how bad I was beat down. He’s told me i inspired him. My mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. I can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for I know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. Moving forward, I’m a decent student, normally averaging around low A’s my brothers straight A’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every A we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). Through out life I feel like I found connections that I would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. I grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. I would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out I remember. Fast forward, around when I was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because I had been getting into random enough Japanese rock from the anime I would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. It did. It really did and I thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. I was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. But at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. I started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. This was a turning point.

Back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and I was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. My dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. All while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and I was a mistake. Nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how I’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. I became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. The first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed Tyler help dad just hit me. In a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. It was a powerful moment. My father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘Twas still a sweet victory. No fear.

I’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. With his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called Fearless Records. We played metal. It was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. 

We did it in four months.

I got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. I cried and got sent home early. A record that I wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. It was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. Every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. Every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! Still makes me proud to this day man. 

Btw, this isn’t a story about my father.
He is not the reason I want to kill myself anymore.

The label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. Our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.

This is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. A foe I don’t know if I can beat this time. Throughout the story so far, I had a flame inside of me. The whole time a purpose to prove. A will to fight. I always told people that I wasn’t sad, I was angry. And the anger forged who I was. A determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. But when that all went away. I became a worm, but not yet.

Shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. I’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and I stopped holding the past against him. At this point I had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. Was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? Yeah, but I was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. Most times shrugging off his comments. I had worth now.

Me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place EP that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. Drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. I can’t help but feel as tho I’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as I’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).

Fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. Me and my brother move to Los Angeles California in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. We moved with two of my friends from NY and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. The other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. It was not comfortable to say the least. However the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (This is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) And then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. But when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. My brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. I refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. Amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. Cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. And it was the last straw for him. Within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. 

I was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. My other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. I thought I’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. He didn’t. 

This was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. I spend every night analyzing the past, and i think I’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. My personality feels like it’s splitting. Some days I’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days I’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. When i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. It’s the only skill i have. I didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, I’m not good at anything and I’m not interested in anything other than music. But there’s no inspiration left in me. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on Instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. Everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. I don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. It’s like I’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. I just want him to die. I just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death. 

Idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic, thanks for listening.",suicidewatch,,Tyler,32.3512601,-95.3010624

Shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. I’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and I stopped holding the past against him. At this point I had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. Was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? Yeah, but I was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. Most times shrugging off his comments. I had worth now.

Me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place EP that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. Drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. I can’t help but feel as tho I’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as I’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).

Fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. Me and my brother move to Los Angeles California in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. We moved with two of my friends from NY and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. The other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. It was not comfortable to say the least. However the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (This is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) And then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. But when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. My brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. I refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. Amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. Cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. And it was the last straw for him. Within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. 

I was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. My other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. I thought I’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. He didn’t. 

This was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. I spend every night analyzing the past, and i think I’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. My personality feels like it’s splitting. Some days I’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days I’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. When i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. It’s the only skill i have. I didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, I’m not good at anything and I’m not interested in anything other than music. But there’s no inspiration left in me. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on Instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. Everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. I don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. It’s like I’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. I just want him to die. I just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death.

Growing up, I was always a really weird kid. I distinctly remember that I had just seen the world differently. It seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. Me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were Mario or Pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. It was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. We didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. As far as I know I was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, I would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. My father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally Hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. When he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. It was better to just stay quiet. This didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and I would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. My real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if I wanted to fight to put my hands up and when I did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. I was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, I have terrible memory of most my life. As I got older, my brother and I actually started bonding, he liked the way I started standing up to our dad no matter how bad I was beat down. He’s told me i inspired him. My mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. I can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for I know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. Moving forward, I’m a decent student, normally averaging around low A’s my brothers straight A’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every A we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). Through out life I feel like I found connections that I would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. I grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. I would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out I remember. Fast forward, around when I was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because I had been getting into random enough Japanese rock from the anime I would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. It did. It really did and I thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. I was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. But at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. I started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. This was a turning point.

Back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and I was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. My dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. All while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and I was a mistake. Nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how I’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. I became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. The first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed Tyler help dad just hit me. In a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. It was a powerful moment. My father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘Twas still a sweet victory. No fear.

I’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. With his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called Fearless Records. We played metal. It was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. 

We did it in four months.

I got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. I cried and got sent home early. A record that I wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. It was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. Every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. Every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! Still makes me proud to this day man. 

Btw, this isn’t a story about my father.
He is not the reason I want to kill myself anymore.

The label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. Our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.

This is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. A foe I don’t know if I can beat this time. Throughout the story so far, I had a flame inside of me. The whole time a purpose to prove. A will to fight. I always told people that I wasn’t sad, I was angry. And the anger forged who I was. A determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. But when that all went away. I became a worm, but not yet.

I’m terrified of being a girl.,"I’m a 14 year old girl who’s weaker than average, I’m thin and short.
I hate being a girl SO MUCH. More than anything. If one day I had proof of reincarnation, I’d kill myself and hope I come back as a boy.
I’m scared of men, I’m scared because men are stronger. I HATE that men are stronger. It’s the most humiliating thing. I hate being built for childbirth, I hate having a bigger chest and wider hips. It’s embarrassing. I want more than anything to be a boy. 
I look really feminine too, and I hate it so much. I’m seriously thinking about just ending it all.
I wish I was a boy so that I would be stronger, but also because I want to look like a boy and be treated like a boy and perceived like a boy. Being a teenage girl in this disgusting, misogynistic world is the most demeaning and humiliating thing ever. Knowing that I’m living off of peoples mercy.
I even have fantasies where I’m a boy and I look like a boy and I do things that I see my brother and father doing. In an ideal world, I’d be a man who loves and protects girls just like me so that they won’t have to feel this way. I want to fight and be strong, and everyone, including biologists, tell me I’ll never even compete to men, so I don’t even try. I don’t exercise, I don’t do anything. I’m severely depressed and anxious. I’m completely paranoid of the people around me, especially men. And It’s not just that, it’s that I want to BE a man just because I do. I want facial hair and a deep voice and thicker eyebrows and an Adam’s apple. I’m just so tired of this. I think I’m just going to end it all, because I can’t be a boy. I’ve gone through thinking about transitioning, but the world is so cruel and hateful towards trans people and I’m scared. The place I’m in has anti trans laws too. So I can’t be trans for my own safety. I’m just stuck being a girl. So it’s two choices:
Be a girl or die.

Edit:
Guys I’m sorry for gender stereotyping.
There isn’t an excuse for my behaviour.
I’m sorry to all the people who I’ve offended and I’m sorry for undermining transmen issues and trying to include myself in them when I don’t belong in that space. I feel like I was being overly dramatic this entire time and I’m sorry to everyone who I’ve caused worry to. Just because I’m sad does not mean I have the right to dump that on other people. I’m sorry everyone.
To everyone telling me to just go to a therapist or a professional, you’re right. It wasn’t right for me to throw my problems at a bunch of strangers.
I’ll call a helpline instead. Thank you for all the help and support.

Edit again:
Upon looking at these comments, I’ve come to the conclusion that being a guy sucks too. Being a girl also sucks. Being nonbinary also sucks. People will continue to hate me for the rest of my life no matter what I do. Based on my gender, but also my race. So I think I am going to kill myself.
I think in reality, I just hate being human, being a person. I hate existing. Maybe this didn’t have much to do with gender at all. I think maybe I just hate myself and everything else. I don’t want to be a girl, I don’t have to be a boy, I don’t want to be anything. The only thing I genuinely want to be is something disgusting. Something people won’t come near or bother. Like a corpse, or a vampire, or a maggot. I don’t like myself and I’m coming to realize I don’t like many people either. I really appreciate all your guy’s help and advice though.

Edit again again: please stop using she/her for me. I understand that it’s confusing because I referred to myself as a girl here, but I feel like I keep commenting and telling people and they don’t seem to listen? Maybe I’m looking too deep into it. But please don’t. Thank you.

Edit again again again: guys can we please stop being so hostile to each other? I didn’t mean for this post to have dozens of angry arguments and profanity under it.

Edit for the millionth time:
At first, when I posted this, I was just very depressed and upset. Now I’m angry.
I posted this to a SUICIDE subreddit looks for support, advice, conversation, or just a listening ear. But for some reason people are arguing with each other, being transphobic, calling other people names and even slurs?? Not to mention the amount of transphobic people trying to ‘defend’ me against the ‘trans agenda’ when I do not need defending of any sort, because I don’t want it. I’m fine. This was a post about how I’m experiencing a difficult time, not an invitation to harass others and deliberately speak over me and try to talk for me. Can we please just stop swearing at each other and attacking each other? This is honestly making me lose hope is society even further.

Edit again: guys stop talking about me getting pregnant. It’s really uncomfortable. I made this post to look for help and support. Instead I have lost faith in people and I’m honestly feeling worse. I’m 14, don’t pull that ‘oh but you might change your mind later’ because I don’t care. There are more reasons to me not being able to have a child that you guys don’t know about. I didn’t even mention pregnancy in this. I really wish people would stop bringing it up. I literally CANNOT be a mother, I’m too unstable and I can’t handle noise. I’m scared of children and I’m severely germaphobic. There are more reasons that I don’t want to list because this post is NOT about me getting pregnant! Stop. Please stop assuming you know me better than I know myself. I really REALLY don’t appreciate it. So stop.

Edit: I hate it here. I really thought that going on a suicide support subreddit would help me.
I know I said to ‘be respectful’ and ‘stop using profanity’ but fuck you guys. Not all of you guys, some of you are really sweet. But really. I’ve officially lost faith in the internet, strangers, and human nature. For some reason someone was talking about how ‘being a woman is an opportunity for me to be a stripper’??? What the fuck??? I’m 14, that’s literally the FIRST line of this post. But I can thank you all for something, thank you for reminding me why parents sometimes say ‘stranger danger’ because you guys are seriously pushing me closer to just ending it all—FOR AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT REASON. Now I just want to kill myself because I hate the world AND myself. So thank you for that. I really appreciate it. And also, I KNOW people have it worse than me, okay? I don’t need a reminder 10x a fucking hour. I’m just so sick of this shit and I’m sick of people in general. I really hoped that this would be a nice supportive subreddit where people could maybe give me advice, and they did! But like half of the people here are literally just subtly encouraging me.

My gf made an attempt,"She has had the toughest life of anyone I've ever known, and yet she's the kindest, most loving person I've ever known. We fit together in so many ways we've never come close to before. We make each other feel normal when the rest of the world does the opposite.

Recently, her anxiety skyrocketed, and she had been a bit more receptive to discussing getting some help (past trauma included incidents related to therapy and psych treatment). I asked again Wednesday night when she started getting antsy again after a calm, positive day. She said she would ""get there,"" she would be ready soon.

Her anxiety spiked a little later that night, and she got upset with me over a very minor misunderstanding. It threw me at first, but I realized it was her anxiety talking and did what I could to help her calm down. The anxiety didn't seem as bad at it had been in nights leading up to that.

We snuggled up in bed and went to sleep. I woke up in the night and noticed she was very tightly holding onto me. She didn't move much when I got up, just kinda rolled over. Same thing when I came back to bed.

I got up for work later, and she apologized for being mean the night before. I apologized for not realizing what was going on at first. Nothing seemed amiss, but she's tough, and mornings are hectic.

She sent the usual sweet message while I was on my way in. Then right after my work day started (and she knew I couldn't get messages for a while), she messaged that she needed to be committed. When I got the message, I asked if she was in danger and messaged our trusted friends near the house. She had reached out to them already, and they were there.

They took her to the ER, she went from there to inpatient.

She took 2500 mg of benadryl. I'm not sure how she woke up. She didn't mean to wake up.

The misunderstanding and everything happened later the night before, and she took the pills before that.

Anyway. She has been receiving inpatient treatment for a couple days. She just got cleared to receive the clothes I dropped off her first night in there. She got a fork at dinner tonight.

We've been able to talk a handful of times. She sounds better and more hopeful each time. I'm so proud of her for finally agreeing to get the help she needs, and I cannot fathom how hard this is for her.

Due to COVID restrictions, no one can have visitors, so she has short phone calls, and she has the photos and books I dropped off. And she has time. She is doing the work and going to sessions and everything (confirmed by her nurses). She is feeling hopeful. She said she was really happy about today.

I'm so glad she's getting help. I know she's in good hands. The facility she's at is local, and I have friends who gave family who've been greatly helped by then, too. I'm also feeling lost being less than a mile from her but unable to give her a hug or even look into her eyes.

We have a small but tight support network of friends, and I don't feel like harming myself. I just don't feel like doing anything other than calling her. 

Sorry if this is the wrong sub. I looked a bit and couldn't find a better fit, and I needed to get this out there.

Update: I just got word that she's been cleared to come home. She has medications to be picked up at the pharmacy, and she has follow up sessions scheduled.

I can't thank you all enough for the kindness and support you've sent our way here. Each night of this has been rough, but last night felt particularly miry. I posted here because, although I have good friends whom I can talk to admit this, and who came through the other day and got her to help while I was gone, I felt a need to just say the story to people who didn't know, who don't know, what was going on or don't know us, etc.

I am so happy she is coming home, and I am so hopeful for the future. I know the struggle is not over, and it's one that will likely go on as long as we're alive (just like my own struggles with mental health), but I am supremely optimistic at the change in her demeanor and her willingness to continue on the path to health and happiness. Together.

Thank you. As silly as it will seem to some people, your comments, messages, and everything have really helped.",suicidewatch,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
Failed suicide attempt,"Yesterday I clean my house, packed my bag with robe and went into the woods. I arrived there at 10pm and smoked a few sigartes and listened to the animal noises. I prepared my rope and let myself drop. The first minute was peacefull but then I started having a panic attack and started seeing all blurry and my hearing went away. If I didn't have my pocket knife to cut the rope I was gone. But I was to much of a coward and cut it. Some people know like my father but they don't care. I really need a hug. I haven't heard or seen someone familiar in the past 2months. I really grave love, understanding, kidness, a hand, a shoulder. I am so lonely. I don't understand that people don't care what happened yesterday I don't. Am I this bad of a person? U don't think so I'm just mentally unstable. Anyone from Belgium whom wants to be my friend? I don't  want to be pathetic but I'm so lonely I miss love so much. I'm going to stop now I don't want to cry ;) thanks in advance for the people reading this.",suicidewatch,,Belgium,50.6402809,4.6667145
Bruh my therapist actually used that stupid motto on me,"”Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.” No it fucking isn’t. It’s a permanent solution to an endless chain of problems, most of which are temporary I admit, but some of which aren’t. And the chain of problems is, in itself, a permanent problem. It’s not like I’m gonna kill myself over some math test, but rather because I don’t enjoy my daily life, because I don’t look forward to almost anything, because of all the unfixable problems that plague this world, because every stupid little thing has become a challenge, because there will always be some bullshit to deal with and because I am undeniably a burden. Yes, I’m struggling right now, yes it’ll get better, but what then? Well it’ll get worse again. It‘s just ups and downs till you die, and the good isn’t worth going through all this shit for. Such a goddamn stupid phrase… Like why do people use it? I really don’t get it.",suicidewatch,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
I hate being a prostitute,"In truth, I actually used to enjoy it years ago. Then, I went to college because I wanted more fulfilling work. Then, I started a business, and even though it's been successful, it's taking longer than I anticipated to fully set up so I can't live off the profits yet. 

So... I had to default to my former work to temporarily makes ends meet and... I'm remembering how dehumanizing it is. I've only been back at it a month and have already had to visit the ER to do a rape kit, have already been facef\*\*\*ed so hard I threw up (despite having not eaten anything that day), have already torn countless times, have already had every 'minor' boundary ignored, and have already lost my sanity having to sleep during the day so I can be available at night. Dehumanizing is an understatement, and the money is only worth it if it's a stepping stone to a better future, and a close one at that.   

I'm dreading the 15th when I have to be back at it until July. My depression is coming back and I really need things to work for me... otherwise... I'll perish.",suicidewatch,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
“You’re not alone” is the biggest bullshit ever ,"I am alone. I’ve always been alone and I’ll always be alone. Being told that I’m wrong and actually there is some mythical person in the world who gives a shit about me is like telling me that Santa Claus loves me. It’s bullshit. I have no friends and my family doesn’t give a fuck about me. Nobody in the rest of the world cares. Everyone just cares about themselves and there is no such thing as empathy or basic human kindness or whatever bullshit. It doesn’t exist. 

It’s embarrassing when I have to make some bullshit “suicide plan” so I can reassure some doctors who don’t actually give a shit that I won’t kill myself, and they ask me to list people who I can talk to when I’m in a crisis and I cannot come up with a single fucking name. And they’re always like “ohhh that’s so sad, really, you don’t have anyone? You can’t think of anyone?” Nope. It’s like they can’t fucking fathom that someone doesn’t have any support system. That never happens in magical happy doctor land. And then the “suicide plan” that I’m forced to make is never mentioned again, and I just go on with my merry life all by myself as usual. It’s such Bull Shit with a capital fucking B. No one actually gives a fuck.

It’s great how I live every day wanting to kill myself and if I show any sign of not being happy I either get screamed at and berated or I get fake sympathy from people who forget about me the second after I stop talking to them. Nobody actually cares. I could kill myself and I doubt anyone would even notice for a while. Everyone will just go on with their merry little life and I’ll be forgotten. I can’t wait for that to happen, because existing in this bullshit life just sucks. Every day sucks and it gets worse every day. What is the fucking point

I jumped off a (small) bridge,"Surprise! I lived. The water was quite a bit deeper than I thought, and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface. I went headfirst, so any debri would have likely killed me outright, or knocked me out and caused me to drawn. 

I still got a concussion just from the water (FYI, concussions suck. Do not recommend). And after I somehow managed to not drown anyway, I swam to shore. Holy crap was it a long, cold walk home. 

Believe it or not, I didn’t think it was that big a deal. It didn’t really feel like a true suicide attempt. More like it blurred the lines between ‘self harm’ and ‘suicide’. Before the jump I had figured a ~90% chance I’d live if the water was deep (I was gambling a lot on that “if”). 

When I got home I told my family, thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin, maybe take the next day off. Nope. Not a chance. We went *straight* to the ER. Then I was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit. 

The psych ward. I was pretty terrified. I didn’t think I was worthy of such care. My issues were mild, weren’t they? It was just (extreme) self harm. 

I spent five days in the hospital. And frankly they were some of the most incredible days I’ve ever experienced in my life. I dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria. At several points, I *was* the hysterical, crying, inconsolable woman who you’d expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket. 

But they didn’t do that to me. They talked to me, and they helped me. They gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself. Somehow, they got me to admit that I *wanted* to live, even though I desperately believed I didn’t deserve to. I’m trying to remember, every minute of every day, that I *do* deserve to live. 

Anyway... that’s kinda my little story. 

TL;DR: Jumped off a bridge, landed in a psych ward, got legit help.

Edit: wow thanks for the support everyone! I’ll try to answer your questions in more detail when I get a chance.

Edit 2: this got a bit more attention than I thought, but I’m glad. If this enourages even one person to consider asking for help, or joining an inpatient phsyciatric program, I’ll be overjoyed.",suicidewatch,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
"My wife died at 27, had been together our whole adult lives","She died 5 days ago after being hospitalised for 2 weeks.

We had been together since high school. Married on 7th July 2023.  She was my best friend, my home and core to all my dreams. 

We shared all our values and life goals, we wanted a family and children. We wanted to see the world and build careers that would let us make a difference. 

She wanted to help victims of violent crimes, she had endless empathy for people and the courage to try to empower those who had suffered from the most horrific crimes.

She followed me from our home in Helsinki to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania where I got a job soon after our wedding. We loved our lives there. She was blossoming, made the sweetest friends, and was working the perfect job that allowed her to work remotely while I worked my office job.

9th August 2024 she falls ill, I figure it's just a flu as I had one too and she tends to always get hit by the flu harder than me. For a full 24 hours I just take care of her at home, thinking rest is all she needs. The next day she is delirious, I still think this might just be a combo of the flu and the aural migraines she would often get. We get to the hospital around midday. It's malaria. I still think: ""they know exactly how to treat malaria here, she'll be just fine""

2 weeks of fighting, complication after complication. On the 24th of August 2024, at 9AM, the doctors tell us her brain herniated, she was brain dead. The next 16 hours we watched her body give up. We were sobbing, sleeping and staring into the void over what was basically already a corpse being kept ""alive"" by tubes and medication. Tanzanian law would not allow her to be unplugged at the moment of brain death. 25th August 3AM, she is pronounced dead.

I'm back in Finland now at my parents' house. I have barely left my childhood bedroom. I dont have a home anymore. I lost my best friend, my first and only love, my future.

I'm in agony, the memories of our life together and her tubed corpse swirling in my head. I dont know how to live without her, I dont know how to function. I feel so alone, despite family and friends trying to be there for me.

I would not want to live, but I cant hurt my family more than they are already hurting. They loved her like a daughter.

the amount of people suffering here is insane,"do you sometimes realize that the amount of people suffering from severe depression and on the brink of killing themselves on this subreddit and outside of this subreddit really speaks the painful truth about our socaity and our world in general? the world we live in ladies and gentlemen are crule uncaring and cold
in this socaity we view the mentaly ill as an outcast an alien a very disgusting and unacceptable creature....which we pretend to care about and try to ""help"" them
if you suffer from cancer or any other illness people can actually acknowledge your pain and know you are suffering
they know how hug your scars are
but with mental illness people sometimes understemate your suffering
people understemate how severe your depression actually is
people say go get therapy, take anti depressiants but its not a 100% cure it never cured everyone((i myself took pills but it never worked))
actually depression and other disorders
never had a magical cure like we have on flu...yet we dont take it seriously 
and the result? suicide

i really wish depression was like a flu it could get away with some medicine
but no ...its like a curse...once you get it
its gonna never stop hurting you
only if its not too late and only if you got some huge will to live you maybe can get through it ...maybe
its like a snake ...eats you from the inside out
first it eats your will to live and then it eats your ability to enjoy things 
and finally when it really completely took over your mind and body ...it will make you wish for death and later on plan it
this snake feeds on neglect truamatizing events
and deep scars left unhealed...and we can only destroy this cursed snake with care , love and good treatment
not risk truamatize suicidal people with more shit...i swear people could never understand us and only the ones who suffer like us can only understand what if really feels like to have this shitty disorder...
if only people could at least show a bit of understand and care
we would'nt ever get to this point
that idea really makes me hate humanity and myself even more...everything bad happens to us is what we deserve 
we all cold and greedy
we all just take take and take
we never give
we never gave to eachother nor to this poor plant
we all deserve to die 
no one is good
if there is good left in us its only minor
god if you even exist please end us already
please end me...i dont want to see myself living inside this hell forever
the hell is in me and in the world
i can never fix myself nor i can fix the fucked up world
the best i could do is just die

edit : one day and this many upvotes? well i gusse there are a lot of people who get me , wow im not completely misunderstood for being a sick fuck!

Please read this if you have the time.,"I'm really hoping somebody sees this, even if that seems selfish.

Maybe this isn't the right place for this. I'm new to this whole Reddit thing, so I was pretty shocked when I found this subreddit. the world is pretty crazy these days, I guess. I have no clue how many people will see this, or if anyone will see it, but I just need a place to vent. So, here's a not-so-short summary of my entire life story.

I was born at a very young age in Korea to a woman and a man (who already had another child, my sister) in a crippling amount of debt. I moved to Canada after a couple of years of living in Korea, my father's irresponsible investments and petty crime following us from across the globe.

I was four when my mother hit me for the first time. I don't remember the particular instance, but it was then for sure. To me, it seemed as if my mother would go out of her way to hit me whenever the opportunity arose. ANY opportunity at all. She would beat me senseless for not cleaning my room or eating too slow, or whatever other trivial matter she felt like punishing me for. There have been far too many instances in my life so far, where I, an innocent child, has cowered at the hands of her mother, thinking it was the end. She has made me fear for my life on numerous accounts.

I was in the third grade when I called my mom a bitch for the first and last time. I just remember being so insanely frustrated with the way she treated me, and the way she was so much more accepting and lax when it came to disciplining my older sister. I muttered it with seething anger on my way out the door that day. She called the school I was attending at the time and told them I was ""sick"". She kept me home and beat me with a metal music stand, aiming for my head, my throat, and just about anywhere else she figured she could land a blow. This went on until my barely present father came home from work. I was sent to school the next day, being given a kiss before I left as if the day before had never happened.

My school performance was never awful. in fact, it was more the opposite. I was considered somewhat of a child prodigy. School was the one place I felt I could truly thrive, if ever. I did have what I would consider seriously awful behaviour in school, as I would lash out at other children with the same violent tendencies as my mother. This was not brought to anybody's attention, so for a very long time, which means it was not corrected until much later in my life.

The (abusive?) cycle kept going the way it was, with her beating the shit out of me for the sake of discipline, and then acting if she was some sort of saint the very next day, with not even a hint of guilt or remorse on her face. I remember being in the fourth grade, sick of being ""disciplined"". I picked up our landline and looked her in the eye,

""I'm going to call the police and tell them everything you do to me."" And she said,""Go ahead, nobody is going to help you."" I felt completely defeated. There was no help for me. There was no escape. Even at the tender age of 9, I started to feel as if there was no escape but death. I felt as if I couldn't talk to anyone about this. 'Mom would probably hit me again.' 'Dad is never home.' ' I know she wouldn't get it.' I knew that if I talked about it at school, that legal troubles were sure to ensue, so I kept my mouth shut for a long time.

Another memorable instance happened in the fifth grade, when my mother fell insanely ill out of nowhere. we were at the pool. She seemed to be completely fine just moments before, but now she was seemingly dying in a changing stall, telling me to get her help over and over again. And I didn't. Call me a heathen. I stood right in front of the stall door and prayed with all my heart and soul that she would just die and leave me alone. She didn't. Some days I still wish that she did.

Fast forward just a little more. There I was, a tender 11, resentful and bitter at the world. I didn't give a shit about anything. I just wanted it to be over. My school performance started to slip, I just couldn't understand like I could before. Anything and Everything was insanely distracting, and I took to watching anime and gameplay videos as a means of escape from the world. Somehow, my hungover teacher would still find any excuse to give me a good mark, and I was still considered a prodigy, despite my near fail scores. I couldn't do math to save my life, but because of the way I was treated, I would chant to myself 'at least I'm smart' to make me feel better about it all. I was accepted into an academic challenge program for junior high, which only further inflated my ego.

When I got to my brand new school, I realized a couple of things: 1. Years of being violent towards my peers left me completely unapproachable. 2. I had extreme trust issues. 3. I was fucking stupid compared to my peers. I so badly wanted junior high to be my break, my way out. I wanted so badly for everything to get better. But I couldn't make any new friends (probably because I was terrifying, we're talking descriptive death threats left and right) and my academics were not improving at all. Focusing was near impossible. I couldn't ever shut my mouth. Everyone hated me. I was at an all time low, and I still didn't have a single soul to tell this to. I couldn't trust those kids at school, they'd hand me over to the police like I was nothing. I never wanted that. I desperately wanted to put my past behind me. My mom had stopped beating me (only after figuring that her multiple illnesses made her weaker than I was) but it still felt as if she would strike again at any moment. I was living on edge at home and school. I managed to raise myself a little, teaching myself to trust little by little. Teaching myself what was morally acceptable.

Eighth grade was somewhat of a breeze. I had friends, and people seemed to no longer think I was terrifying.

Maybe this isn't the right place for this. I'm new to this whole Reddit thing, so I was pretty shocked when I found this subreddit. the world is pretty crazy these days, I guess. I have no clue how many people will see this, or if anyone will see it, but I just need a place to vent. So, here's a not-so-short summary of my entire life story.

I was born at a very young age in Korea to a woman and a man (who already had another child, my sister) in a crippling amount of debt. I moved to Canada after a couple of years of living in Korea, my father's irresponsible investments and petty crime following us from across the globe.

I was four when my mother hit me for the first time. I don't remember the particular instance, but it was then for sure. To me, it seemed as if my mother would go out of her way to hit me whenever the opportunity arose. ANY opportunity at all. She would beat me senseless for not cleaning my room or eating too slow, or whatever other trivial matter she felt like punishing me for. There have been far too many instances in my life so far, where I, an innocent child, has cowered at the hands of her mother, thinking it was the end. She has made me fear for my life on numerous accounts.

I was in the third grade when I called my mom a bitch for the first and last time. I just remember being so insanely frustrated with the way she treated me, and the way she was so much more accepting and lax when it came to disciplining my older sister. I muttered it with seething anger on my way out the door that day. She called the school I was attending at the time and told them I was ""sick"". She kept me home and beat me with a metal music stand, aiming for my head, my throat, and just about anywhere else she figured she could land a blow. This went on until my barely present father came home from work. I was sent to school the next day, being given a kiss before I left as if the day before had never happened.

My school performance was never awful. in fact, it was more the opposite. I was considered somewhat of a child prodigy. School was the one place I felt I could truly thrive, if ever. I did have what I would consider seriously awful behaviour in school, as I would lash out at other children with the same violent tendencies as my mother. This was not brought to anybody's attention, so for a very long time, which means it was not corrected until much later in my life.

The (abusive?) cycle kept going the way it was, with her beating the shit out of me for the sake of discipline, and then acting if she was some sort of saint the very next day, with not even a hint of guilt or remorse on her face. I remember being in the fourth grade, sick of being ""disciplined"". I picked up our landline and looked her in the eye,

""I'm going to call the police and tell them everything you do to me."" And she said,""Go ahead, nobody is going to help you."" I felt completely defeated. There was no help for me. There was no escape. Even at the tender age of 9, I started to feel as if there was no escape but death. I felt as if I couldn't talk to anyone about this. 'Mom would probably hit me again.' 'Dad is never home.' ' I know she wouldn't get it.' I knew that if I talked about it at school, that legal troubles were sure to ensue, so I kept my mouth shut for a long time.

Another memorable instance happened in the fifth grade, when my mother fell insanely ill out of nowhere. we were at the pool. She seemed to be completely fine just moments before, but now she was seemingly dying in a changing stall, telling me to get her help over and over again. And I didn't. Call me a heathen. I stood right in front of the stall door and prayed with all my heart and soul that she would just die and leave me alone. She didn't. Some days I still wish that she did.

Fast forward just a little more. There I was, a tender 11, resentful and bitter at the world. I didn't give a shit about anything. I just wanted it to be over. My school performance started to slip, I just couldn't understand like I could before. Anything and Everything was insanely distracting, and I took to watching anime and gameplay videos as a means of escape from the world. Somehow, my hungover teacher would still find any excuse to give me a good mark, and I was still considered a prodigy, despite my near fail scores. I couldn't do math to save my life, but because of the way I was treated, I would chant to myself 'at least I'm smart' to make me feel better about it all. I was accepted into an academic challenge program for junior high, which only further inflated my ego.

When I got to my brand new school, I realized a couple of things: 1. Years of being violent towards my peers left me completely unapproachable. 2. I had extreme trust issues. 3. I was fucking stupid compared to my peers. I so badly wanted junior high to be my break, my way out. I wanted so badly for everything to get better. But I couldn't make any new friends (probably because I was terrifying, we're talking descriptive death threats left and right) and my academics were not improving at all. Focusing was near impossible. I couldn't ever shut my mouth. Everyone hated me. I was at an all time low, and I still didn't have a single soul to tell this to. I couldn't trust those kids at school, they'd hand me over to the police like I was nothing. I never wanted that. I desperately wanted to put my past behind me. My mom had stopped beating me (only after figuring that her multiple illnesses made her weaker than I was) but it still felt as if she would strike again at any moment. I was living on edge at home and school. I managed to raise myself a little, teaching myself to trust little by little. Teaching myself what was morally acceptable.

I had proof, I had witnesses, I was the only woman working with all men and I actually loved my job but sadly I couldn’t tolerate the harassment anymore. I was terminated after reporting all of this and the reason was because I wasn’t a “good fit”. It was humiliating. Being escorted out while the men I reported laughed at me … the worst feeling in the world.

I want to kill myself. I want to die. NSFW,"**trigger warning - talk of sexual and physical abuse.There is no TL DR, I need to vent. I've never told anyone the entirety of my life. I never wrote down how I felt. I want to see if it helps.**

&#x200B;

I was physically abused by my father. I remember one time he slammed/pushed the kitchen table into my chest while I was eating dinner. It pressed my chair up against the wall, then pushed all the air out of my chest. I remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp, as the table was pulled away.

When I tried to get up, while on hands and knees, I was kicked in my stomach by him. I don't remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my 2 brothers. I was 8. This is ONE story.

&#x200B;

My great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity. Until I was in my 20's I was reminded daily about how worthless I was over something I had no control over. He basically stepped in as the father figure. I would spend my summers in Southern California helping him super his apartments until I was about 17.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was also sexual abused.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was raped.

&#x200B;

To me, those are two separate things. When the abuse started, I physically enjoyed it. Had no idea. Then I was brutally sodomized. Then I grew up just a little and that's when I started to hate distrust and not like anyone. I built a fake smile. I built an auto pilot response for everyday things. I don't think. When I can, I do what I can to stop.

&#x200B;

From the ages of 9, to about 14 I was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years older(We'll call the fat ugly rapist FMC). I felt like shit because at the start I liked it. I didn't know what was happening to me, I just felt. By the time I was 12, I started to feel disgusted. By 14, I fucking hated everyone. I don't care to discuss the last time he abused me but I will say I don't think he EVER put himself in the position he was in. He left me alone at that point.

By the time I was 18, I was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people I went to school with (gang related and they didn't want to get in trouble, and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if I get caught? I was a minor), they all deserved \*this is just how I felt at the time\* it and it was my only outlet. It was shit like, kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school. Or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend. Shit like like that. The last time I did something like this for example - Some kid who was a senior ( over 18 at the time )had his stereo stolen. He gave me $50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it ( 16yo ). He reminded me of the boy who raped me. When I punched that kid, all I could see was that fat piece of shit FMC. When he was on the ground, in the fencing position, I drug and slammed him around by is hair. Into the side walk. I picked him off the ground, while he was dead weight- and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence. I was expelled and arrested for assault. I tested out of High school. I have never ever been violent with ANYONE since then. All the way till now and I'm 36.

During my time in School, seventh through high school, I hated everyone. Fuck em. I had only 1 real friend and I had one crush on a girl. One. It lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before FMC learned about it. He didn't like it. He told David my best friend at the time (he had no idea FMC was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family) that I had made out with her. He knew David liked her. David, pissed from hearing this, asked Christian. Of course she denied it. It never happened, it wasn't true. I was now known as a Liar. She went to church and school with me. I was 13 at the time, so from grade school right on through to high school, if I went to church with you or school, I was a liar. So the one girl I've ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar. My best friend, no longer, because now I'm a liar. This was what happened the first time I ever told another person I had FEELINGS twards someone else. One little bitty crush. Now - No social life. Destroyed. Home life also. Behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell. I liked girls. was being raped by a 300lb+ fat fucking boy. I hated FMC, after my last altercation with him I was close to or at 15. About a year goes by. No girls look at me. Small town. I don't like them, because they hate me, I lie about making out with em. I wanted to have sex though. To be clear, I wanted to fuck. I had been fucked. I wanted to have joy... Just once... So I had a plan. When I was around 16, doing the summer Super Job for my Grandfather, I paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because I wanted to know what sex was like with a woman. When I got back to Northern California after the summer job at gramps, I told my older brother and he called me a liar. I never told him anything personal up until recently because of that. now my family thinks I'm a liar, and hates me to.

&#x200B;

So at this point I am 18 and I fucking hate everyone. My dad also starts developing a mental disorder. He slowly is becoming mentally disabled. I figured, fuck him. Some karma.

&#x200B;

I decide to move out. My cousin, she moves in with me. I was growing weed at the time. Played video games. Didn't think.

She and I connected. She was the first person I ever felt ANY affection for. She didn't want to use me. She didn't want hurt me. She wanted to know why I was hurt. My head at this point of my life is just so fucked I think/confuse that with her romantically liking me. I did my best to sleep with her. She out of guilt, w/e let me. She knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together.

I knew her from the age of 1-5, then met her again when she was 17. I, out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the ONLY person I actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or w/e my cousin into an incestuous relationship. I wanted to kill myself. I kicked her out of the apt. She moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years. I felt I was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that.

&#x200B;

I was going to kill myself.

&#x200B;

My grandmother, the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis. She was a chef. So I learned to cook and take care of her. I learned that I enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking. This was the first time I felt ANY joy from someone else. People. My grandmother died when I was around 26. she killed her self, the pain was to much. I hate saying this but, I didn't really care. I love her... but I didn't care. At least she wasn't in pain....

&#x200B;

I felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time. No love, no hate.

&#x200B;

So until about the age of 27, I got hit on multiple times. I am not unattractive I guess. I was in 8 physical relationships in my twenties. 2 I sorta developed feelings for. I never asked any of them out. I never once told them I loved them. I never lied to them or cheated. They asked me out, they persude me.  Sex was a chore. I love sex in my head. I love to  masturbate . Watch a healthy amount of porn. But actually having sex..... ugh, I would rather  masturbate  tbh. Everything sex reminded me of two things, the only person I care for and still love like a sister now, my cousin; which makes me sick to my stomach because I felt I manipulated her into doing something horrible, and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit.

With porn at least I can choose any nice loving thing that I want. I like scenes where you can tell there really into each other...  And I don't have to think.

\`

At 28 I was in love for the first time.  Met her at work.

&#x200B;

She started everything. I mean EVERYTHING. She broke up with her boyfriend AT work. Asked me out in front of him the next week. For 6 months she was in a relationship with me, for 6 months I thought we were together. For 6 months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than 5 years at this point, used me to further his cuckold fantasy. When I found him literally in the closet one night in MY FUCKING APARTMENT that she snuck him into that day at what time I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who I thought was with me, I flipped out. My life is insane, WTF IS THIS SHIT. Melony thought I was going to kill them. I might've. She left, both naked, with my blanket, peeling out of the parking lot. I quit that job the next day.

&#x200B;

I want to kill myself. Have it planned.

&#x200B;

My father develops a bad health issue, compounded with his now mental age of around 7, his health his slipping. fast.

&#x200B;

I move in with him, the state pays for me to take care of him. I do nothing but play video games and smoke weed. I'm waiting. I tell myself, ""When he dies. I go to.""

&#x200B;

At 31, I leave the house maybe once a month. My older brother decides he wants to reach out cause I'm a ""little"" closed off. At the age of 32 He includes me in his hobby. At 34, I turned it into what might now be a carrier. I still take care of my father. I am not so sad anymore.

I'm 36, I'm doing well at the job I can make into a career. I met someone. Another Co worker. And for the first time, no confusion, I have a full blown crush as an adult. She's nothing special to look at. Not ugly in any way. But my god the personality, her choice in music, so many things in common. Thinking about her makes me smile. She initiated the flirting. We chatted for hours and hours for weeks. This did not happen over night. She has been there for 7 months at this point, and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time. Also the subjects she would bring up. She was very much flirting. So of course I tell her. No way can I have any regrets.

&#x200B;

So today I come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door. Witch is not normal. I ask her if I can talk to her about something later at lunch. We get ice cream some times together so I figured that would be the time. She just avoided and left me standing there after I asked if we could talk later. Didn't answer. So I asked her at the end of the day. Told her how I felt, and the last thing that I wanted was for her to feel weird at work.  Then she told me she has some one, and it's ""complicated"". I am almost positive, she likes another coworker. I see them text each other all the time. Didn't think anything of it till today. The thing is, yesterday I mentioned I might ask her out the next day joking around when I seen the other co worker in the parking lot, the one I think she likes. He doesn't work in the building with us. Hadn't seen or talked to him at all today. He Laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out. Pretty sure he told her the day before, it made so much sense after I thought about it. The way she avoided me.

&#x200B;

She wants nothing to do with me. Went from conversations, her staring at me when she thought I wasn't looking, to her actively avoiding me at work. In just one day. I went from feeling again. I went from finally feeling like I can open up to someone. I even entertained being normal once. I felt again for someone else ONCE MORE. This time it wasn't misplaced I told myself. I should have listened to myself when I told me not to even think like that. because it wont happen. It won't. Never in my life will I ever find someone that wants me for me, not to use me. Never in my life will I want the person that does. I will not be happy.

All I want for my coworker is to be happy. I don't think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious. I think it's just terrible timing. Or this is hell.

&#x200B;

I think I'm done. Thinking about headed to sleep.  I will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything... All I know is, I got to feel for once, and what I felt was what people do normally. I couldn't even once in my life have one thing ONE fucking thing normal. I can't be happy I guess. Fuck this world.

UPDATE- I made it home from work. While I was at work I felt comfortable enough to talk a LITTLE to a co - worker. Gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than I thought it would be. he helped just by listening. That being said, she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness. Didn't have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didn't have to leave together. I just want her to feel comfortable at work. It's not her fault at all. Also everyone at work knows. Everyone including both my bosses thought the same as I did about my co-workers interest in me. One even asked the girl I liked I guess, ""how long do you think it will take before you two hook up?"". So I guess my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. Just wish she didn't play games. All I know is I can't choose how I feel and I bet she's no different. So I am just going to be myself for right now. Do what I do. Don't think, just do. But fuck, I'm still so fucking tired of being nothing, feeling nothing. At least today I felt like shit =) I mean, that at least is something...  


Another thing I will add is my older brother and I have different fathers and my cousin is not a blood relative of his. ",suicidewatch,,School,35.2034465,129.06015376613541
i lost everyone because of a suicide attempt,"i lost my 3 best friends in the entire world because i told 1 (one) of them about how a suicide attempt on thanksgiving lead to me going to the ER and getting treatment. then they all started ignoring me. then individually texted me saying they do not want to be around me nor speak to me. they said my anxiety ""takes over all our conversations"" and when i have panic attacks and PTSD attacks it stresses them out. these attacks being, of course, something i cannot control and haven't been able to control for the last 4 years we've been a great friend group. they said they can't be friends with someone who tried to kill themselves because it stresses them out too much.

this is high school, obviously. and they're glaring at me and telling other people not to talk to me and talking bad about me and pointing at me and it's just making me more suicidal. someone for the love of god tell me it gets better after high school. if it doesn't, there's a suicide note in my notes app for all of you.

edit: i love this subreddit. thank you to everyone. even just the smallest bit of support makes me calm down enough to think clearly. thank you thank you thank you. you all deserve the most.

P.S. i am in fact a 17 year old girl not a guy but i get the confusion <3

  
EDIT 6 MONTHS AFTER ISSUE: so, update. it took 6 months, but i'm in a slightly better place with the girls i talked about. i've never gotten an apology, and i'm still hurt, but i forgive them immediately BECAUSE i'm in high school and i HAVE to spend time with them, so i might as well not be dreading every day.

my main friend i lost was given a personalized note by me after we closed our run of footloose at our school. she then, a few days later, hugged me for a very long time and kept repeating that she really liked the note. i'm now unblocked and not terrified to speak to her or be around her anymore, so that's a HUGE help with MY mental health. i've known her for years and apologies are not something she has done or ever WILL do, but instead it's little gestures like laughing at my jokes, offering to take pictures of me when i look cute, and grabbing my hands when she wants to talk to me. in an ideal world i would tell her that we're not going to be friends until i am apologized to. but i need to survive without hating my life every day.

the second good friend i lost just kind of fell back into easy rapport with me. she was the one i know was being manipulated into staying away from me. 

the third one is one i know has continued shit talking me and making (very vague) things up about me. i'm super stressed about that still because i just want to be in a good standing with all of my peers, but a friend of mine reminded me recently that this is all PROGRESS, and that reminder makes me endlessly happy.

  
to you all, THANK YOU. i am shocked i didn't have another attempt on my life in these past few months. coming back to these comments and reminders was a safe space for me. thank you.",suicidewatch,,P.S.,52.3706915,4.8843048
i almost killed myself,"but i didn’t. 

yay? i guess?

i almost drove off the cliff. i was so close to doing it. but i sat in my car and i screamed, 

“JUST GO HOME. JUST GO HOME. JUST GO HOME. JUST GO HOME.”

until i made it home. and then i sat in my driveway and sobbed.

when i went inside, i broke down in front of my roommates and had a severe panic attack and my roommate just rubbed my back and helped me breath.

the next day, my best friend took me out to eat. i told her i almost did it. and she said “i could tell a few days before that you were off. and i didn’t say anything. i’m sorry, i should have. i didn’t want you to feel like i was smothering you.” 

but it just meant a lot that she noticed and that i could talk to her about it.

So this is how it ends (an Adult suicide),"Let me be clear. I am not 18. Or 16. Or 21. I am 39, soon to be 40. I had a great life.  Then I lost my job. Then I lost my house. Then my friends. Then  freedom and independence. I am now the stereotypical loser living with their parents. No job. No life. No happiness.

The crazy thing about suicide is that rarely does it come out of the blue.   It's a buildup of a lot of stuff.  
I wouldn't say all of this is my fault. The job market and economy is crap. I could work minimum wage again, but honestly when you have nothing to look forward to this is what happens.  America has gotten rough.

Take this story as a cautionary tale. Get help when you are younger. The older you get, the harder it is to change your thought patterns. Depression and Anxiety got to me, and have won. 30 years ago they didnt have the treatment and awareness they have now.  There is hope for you younger adults.

Too late for me. I screwed up too many times. While my classmates got married and rose up the ladder, I kept pace until 6 months ago.  Life throws curveballs like this, but it knocked me down and frankly nobody cares. I got left in the dust by my friends. My parents pity me while my siblings have great lives. The worse part about being suicidal is people filling you with false hope so you will shut up and leave them alone.

I had some good times, some bad times, and sad times in life. But depression and anxiety won the war while I won some battles. I did the best I could.

I hope that this can help someone so they dont end up like me.  Work hard, listen to your peers, dont burn bridges. Get therapy and medication right away if yoh are struggling.  Don't end up like me. Dying is tragic but having a really pathetic life before dying is even worse.

May others find happiness that I could not on this Earth.

My boyfriend (M24) tried to kill himself and I (M23) can't trust him anymore,"TW suicide 

I'm still very shaken up about the whole things and I'm trying to gather my thoughts. Two days ago my boyfriend attempted suicide. He did it when I was asleep. He went to the bathroom, swallowed a handful of pills and slit his wrists. I found him after a bit cause the light in the bathroom wouldn't let me sleep. He's still in the hospital now. But despite that, I haven't been able to fall asleep at home. I feel like I let myself drop my guard one too many times and now I need to constantly be aware and focus, to not let anything bad happen again. I can't imagine what our relationship is going to be like when he's back home. I've done everything that's humanly possible to help him with his addiction, his trauma, I supported him to the best of my abilities. But I have a breaking point too and I don't know if there's anything more that I can do to help him. And I don't even know if we as a couple have a future anymore. I don't know how to talk to him, how to look him in the eye. It's an absolute mess.",suicidewatch,,M23,34.6460783,135.5152725
Too Cowardly To Kill Myself But Too Depressed To Keep Living,"This is not going to be an easy post for anyone to read or for me to write. To establish things immediately, no I am not considering s\*\*cide or am I in immediate danger. I would never do that to my mom, the one person in this world who truly knows me and cares about me.

With that said, I think I'm just done with life. It's been building for awhile and it just keeps building. It doesn't have much to do with the Coronavirus or the Riots but those have been the final straws. The Coronavirus has taken away my ability to even attempt to make new friends, try new activities or even do things I enjoyed like traveling and playing tennis. Luckily workouts have resumed in my state so I can do that. The riots have taken away my love for sports and history. It seems like everything I love slowly but surely is being taken away from me by various forces.

Even the activities I enjoy I don't enjoy as much as I used to. I feel like all they do is temporarily dull the mental and physical pain that I now feel constantly.

The Coronavirus has shown me just how hollow and empty my life has become. God is definitely not in my life and I am angry at him for various things (that I'll get into here in a minute). I am single and I have no kids or even pets to keep my company. While others at least had family to keep them company I've had no one. This Coronavirus pandemic has officially isolated me. Most of my family live in another state and I would be hesitant to travel for fear of getting them sick. Plus my nieces wouldn't see me anyway, they've bought into all the fear.

I have failed so often at dating it's become comical. I decided to get back into dating with stuff opening up. I went on a date on Tuesday that I thought was going well. We played mini golf but then, according to her, her perfume started messing with her allergies. We didn't have any food or drinks after the round as she felt like she needed to go home. I contact her Thursday where she tells me that she's been seeing another guy for awhile and that they have decided to be official and she wants to see where it goes. Needless to say I sent a nice little message to her, nothing rude but telling her I thought it was pretty low to have gone on a date with me knowing I had no chance. Like so many other times in my dating life I just felt used.

Besides being single with no kids or no pets I don't have a lot of friends. The few I do have know I struggle with depression at times and really do try to help. They all think I'm a very good guy who's just had bad luck and they truly believe I'm a good guy who deserves love and happiness. I just don't know if it's in my cards at this point.

Besides that my body failed on me pretty early. I'm 35 but my body started failing on me around 30. Always had high blood pressure that was hereditary. Now I'm slightly overweight, have hemorrhoids occasionally and also suffer from allergies and eosinophilic asthma. I was on a flight to Nashville back in 2017 (2 hour flight) where my throat really dried out. I started to panic which then caused my asthma to flare up. No medical emergency but it was a horrible flight. Now my doctor has me take a Xanax 0.25mg tablet before the flight to relax and a Prednisone 50mg tablet to control the Asthma. It's worked but whereas I used to love flying I now dread it. I feel like it's destroyed my ability to travel, I don't want to fly for longer than a few hours. But there's so many places I've wanted to see. I've asked my doctor about it and I've asked a Pulmonologist about it but they don't seem to take it seriously. I think they think it's all mental for me at this point. Ever since I became afraid to fly it's destroyed me a piece at a time.

So besides my body betraying me my mind has betrayed me as well. I know I've suffered from some Anxiety like I mentioned but even my therapist won't officially diagnose me with Depression. My mind is always half empty and I think my physical conditions have caused my mind to deteriorate.

All in all part of me truly wants to believe in reincarnation. That we get multiple chances at this life and that I'll just get another chance. I know Christian religions don't believe in reincarnation but it's one of the few things that gives me hope. I will say this, I think God made a mistake having me be born during this time. I believe I was born in the wrong time.

I have a job that's a good job but it's ultimately a dead end job. I've never been one who had that light click on in terms of a passion. I've always been adrift in terms of what I want to do. Yes I have a Bachelor's Degree with a double major in Management and Marketing. I also have my SHRM Certification as a Certified HR Professional. But if I'm honest I don't have a passion for any of it.

So my personal life is a mess. My physical health s\*cks, my mental health s\*cks. I don't have many friends and my dating life is an absolute failure. I feel like a lot of my passions are being taken away from me one by one. The Coronavirus is going to make it impossible to make new friends. The Riots have shown me that a lot of country hates me for my very existence. They hate me just for being a white conservative male.

I am a walking contradiction. I don't want to die and don't have to guts to but I've lost most of my will to live. I've wasted my youth, my best days are behind me and not in front of me and I no longer have any zest for life. Deep down pretty much nothing makes my happy anymore. Sure some activities dull the pain temporarily but I've lost the ability to feel happy. I've lost the ability to connect with people. I've lost any ability to have empathy or compassion. I just feel like I don't care anymore.

I don't know what I'm asking for out of this, I just had to finally get it out. I really don't know what to do at this point. If I could I really wish there was a ""do over"" button that we could press and start again. I wouldn't make all the mistakes I've made in my life. I would try to not be so da\*n introverted when I was younger which made it hard to make friends. I would've traveled the world before my health made my ability to travel by air an iffy proposition. I would've tried more activities to maybe find a passion.

I don't anymore guys. It just all feels so hopeless. If I had to use one emotion to describe myself at this very moment I think that's the one I would use. Hopeless.

The emergency room treats people with mental health issues like shit.,"I was admitted last night to the ER for a suicide attempt. I was very upset and had multiple panick attacks.

I know I needed help. Yet the doctor send me away. In the next hour I was rushed in by ambulance for a more serious attempt. Which could have been avoided if the doctor actually would have listend to me. 

The attempt caused me to have surgery. Note, I’m extremely anxious about anesthesia etc. So I tried to walk away, the nurses forced me back in bed. After a couple of minutes i tried to walk away again, this time they put me into seclusion. I told them i didn’t want to take off my pants because of a recent rape, they proceeded to push me to the ground and forced them of me. This made me have a severe panick attack. I was left alone.

After a while I got out of seclusion, still visibly upset. They wanted to put the saturation thiny on my finger but I didn’t give it straight away because i was wiping my tears. I got dragged to seclusion because of this. 

This morning I got the surgery, i tried to comply as much as possible. The surgery went well and i got into a recovery room. The doctor came and told me I was free to go. I told him I will try to kill myself again. He said that thats a risk he’s willing to take. 

Right now I’m sitting on my bathroom floor in tears not knowing what I should do next.

Oh and btw, they called my parents. Eventhough I told them i don’t want that. I am 18, so they can’t share information without my consent

I got a gun to kill myself and my parents found out about it before I could do it.,"Hello, everyone. Pretty long rant ahead so grab something if you care to read.

I'm a 17-year-old dude, I live somewhere in North Africa, I've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. I'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying I've been dealing with since I was young, I don't really get bullied now but I can get verbally hurt as I can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. Anyways, I didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. Mostly, they get bored of me or I just push them away. I decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. But it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. I decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever I ate, etc.. A year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed then with Schizophrenia and Severe Depression, I began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and I wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., I was in the last year of High School and exams came so I stopped going to the psychiatrist. I got a really bad grade despite doing my best, I stopped taking my medications cold turkey. I went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. I was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. My plan was ruined and I'm under some kind of suicide watch. I really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to ""Man up!"" and ""A lot of people are going through worse"", I'm also kinda guilt-tripped.

Suicide is.. scarier the closer it is. Ending it soon. I was somebody ♡,"This isn't the ""coward's"" way out. It really isn't.

Even though I'm unbelievably fortunate this method is relatively painless, quick, and unassuming enough not to look gruesome, a part of me *is* scared. I used to say ""when I have a peaceful method, it'll be easy.."" but now that the time has come, I was really naive. I believe in the afterlife and consciousness after death, but I honestly don't mind if I am just unaware and I'm no more troubled than when I'm asleep..

To the people reading, I am so, so sorry you are trapped in atrocious circumstances or suffering such as war, unjust treatment, domestic violence, inescapable poverty, loneliness, crimes against humanity, the terror of being your biological gender but not having the resources and support to transition, and so many other injustices you do not deserve. This world is unabashedly brutal and horrible and I'm disheartened and disgusted that this the world we live in. I see you're trying to defend your fire against forces greater than yourself, and I am proud of you for living another day. Some days are more overpowering than others, but I want you to understand that is no reflection of inherent unworthiness or lack on your part. You are doing what you can with the tools (if any exist) you understand how to use, so please do not beat yourself up more than you are already breaking. Thank you for the chance you read this and we met. I wish to you all for external and internal resources come your way, freedom from suffering, empowerment, autonomy, courage, healing, resilience, personal fulfillment, growth, mercy and comfort for yourself, total fulfillment of your basic and inherent needs, and an abundance moments of expansive and loving joy. ♡

I even wish this for the people that have hurt me or willingly harmed others, because if we all possessed these things—especially the latter (as suffering is inevitable to some degree)—there would be no need or desire to cause harm. They could connect with others and themselves in the most positive and fulfilling of ways. At least.. that's how I feel.

I wish I could have made a great and bright impact on the world. The reason I am probably so hesitant is that my life has barely begun. I'm twenty years old. If I gave myself twenty to thirty years, I could probably gauge my impact, figure out what is wrong and strive for something better for everyone. I wish everyone felt that way to some degree. Though, some people are afraid of opening Pandora's box and don't realize they're actually in it.

If you read all this, thank you for reading. I hope I could make your day a little bit better. Thank you.

  
**Update (10/04/24)** :

I missed my ticket.  A few days ago, I tried to die and woke up the next morning with the most excruciating migraine and bodily weakness of my life. I still feel a bit weak. I see where I messed up a step and why I lived.  As of now, I'm on the margins of figuring out what to do next. Even though mind is in a weird place, I do know that I'd like to thank and hug everyone who felt moved by my note. 

It is fact there is endless and boundless suffering in life. I am so sorry you cannot escape your undeserved agony, and I have my deepest compassion for your trying. You do not deserve this in the first place. For those whose suffering is more than they are capable of enduring, and whose challenges are practically insurmountable, I send you the highest and brightest peace, self-love and courage and my respect for your autonomy to make the best possible choice for yourself. To those who choose to pursue living, I eagerly support you to continue! I know it is hard. This cycle of inner struggle—spiraling, self-doubt, bitterness, frustration, delusion—is baked into our humanity, and we may never fully step out of that cycle until our last breath. But you know what? While we are alive, I rejoice in the days, moments, minutes, and seconds to spare you aren't caught in that cycle and feel connected with and free.

I purposely didn't elaborate what pushed me to suicide in my note, because this note isn't about me; it is about you. Whether you sobbed, felt your stomach drop in fear, or clenched your fists in self-frustration, I dream you confront what your subconscious yearns for and achieve it. 

If I may include, this world *is* unbelievably fucking awful and cruel and full of suffering. I cannot dress up that undeniable truth in pretty words and still keep my integrity.

 Knowing this—nearly dying—I realize there are things I wanted to do. I wanted to make the world a better place. I wanted to make people smile, to make people laugh. I wanted to lower people's guards and help them feel joy again. I wanted to ease people's stress and invite laughter. I wanted to help people open their Pandora's box and show them there is still merit in staying in this world despite the horrors. I wanted every interaction I have to be raw, energetic, vulnerable, and alive, so that no one ever felt warranted to question my intentions; instead, they remember the humanity flowing in their veins. I wanted to wake up every morning and feel self-confident from sunrise to sunset, knowing that this is the gift I would deliver to you personally, and I would do it again and again and again. 

...Now, despite that..

 ..I am just as much as hesitant to live as I was to die. Even though I feel in tune with my life's purpose, the lack of noise in death fulfills a large part of me that life cannot. If I had given myself another twenty-five to thirty years, I could have departed on my deathbed with my head held high and spine erect. But that isn't now. Frankly, a part of me wishes it were.

Suicide is.. scarier the closer it is. Ending it soon. I was somebody ♡,"This isn't the ""coward's"" way out. It really isn't.

Even though I'm unbelievably fortunate this method is relatively painless, quick, and unassuming enough not to look gruesome, a part of me *is* scared. I used to say ""when I have a peaceful method, it'll be easy.."" but now that the time has come, I was really naive. I believe in the afterlife and consciousness after death, but I honestly don't mind if I am just unaware and I'm no more troubled than when I'm asleep..

To the people reading, I am so, so sorry you are trapped in atrocious circumstances or suffering such as war, unjust treatment, domestic violence, inescapable poverty, loneliness, crimes against humanity, the terror of being your biological gender but not having the resources and support to transition, and so many other injustices you do not deserve. This world is unabashedly brutal and horrible and I'm disheartened and disgusted that this the world we live in. I see you're trying to defend your fire against forces greater than yourself, and I am proud of you for living another day. Some days are more overpowering than others, but I want you to understand that is no reflection of inherent unworthiness or lack on your part. You are doing what you can with the tools (if any exist) you understand how to use, so please do not beat yourself up more than you are already breaking. Thank you for the chance you read this and we met. I wish to you all for external and internal resources come your way, freedom from suffering, empowerment, autonomy, courage, healing, resilience, personal fulfillment, growth, mercy and comfort for yourself, total fulfillment of your basic and inherent needs, and an abundance moments of expansive and loving joy. ♡

I even wish this for the people that have hurt me or willingly harmed others, because if we all possessed these things—especially the latter (as suffering is inevitable to some degree)—there would be no need or desire to cause harm. They could connect with others and themselves in the most positive and fulfilling of ways. At least.. that's how I feel.

I wish I could have made a great and bright impact on the world. The reason I am probably so hesitant is that my life has barely begun. I'm twenty years old. If I gave myself twenty to thirty years, I could probably gauge my impact, figure out what is wrong and strive for something better for everyone. I wish everyone felt that way to some degree. Though, some people are afraid of opening Pandora's box and don't realize they're actually in it.

If you read all this, thank you for reading. I hope I could make your day a little bit better. Thank you.

  
**Update (10/04/24)** :

I missed my ticket.  A few days ago, I tried to die and woke up the next morning with the most excruciating migraine and bodily weakness of my life. I still feel a bit weak. I see where I messed up a step and why I lived.  As of now, I'm on the margins of figuring out what to do next. Even though mind is in a weird place, I do know that I'd like to thank and hug everyone who felt moved by my note. 

It is fact there is endless and boundless suffering in life. I am so sorry you cannot escape your undeserved agony, and I have my deepest compassion for your trying. You do not deserve this in the first place. For those whose suffering is more than they are capable of enduring, and whose challenges are practically insurmountable, I send you the highest and brightest peace, self-love and courage and my respect for your autonomy to make the best possible choice for yourself. To those who choose to pursue living, I eagerly support you to continue! I know it is hard. This cycle of inner struggle—spiraling, self-doubt, bitterness, frustration, delusion—is baked into our humanity, and we may never fully step out of that cycle until our last breath. But you know what? While we are alive, I rejoice in the days, moments, minutes, and seconds to spare you aren't caught in that cycle and feel connected with and free.

I purposely didn't elaborate what pushed me to suicide in my note, because this note isn't about me; it is about you. Whether you sobbed, felt your stomach drop in fear, or clenched your fists in self-frustration, I dream you confront what your subconscious yearns for and achieve it. 

If I may include, this world *is* unbelievably fucking awful and cruel and full of suffering. I cannot dress up that undeniable truth in pretty words and still keep my integrity.

 Knowing this—nearly dying—I realize there are things I wanted to do. I wanted to make the world a better place. I wanted to make people smile, to make people laugh. I wanted to lower people's guards and help them feel joy again. I wanted to ease people's stress and invite laughter. I wanted to help people open their Pandora's box and show them there is still merit in staying in this world despite the horrors. I wanted every interaction I have to be raw, energetic, vulnerable, and alive, so that no one ever felt warranted to question my intentions; instead, they remember the humanity flowing in their veins. I wanted to wake up every morning and feel self-confident from sunrise to sunset, knowing that this is the gift I would deliver to you personally, and I would do it again and again and again. 

...Now, despite that..

 ..I am just as much as hesitant to live as I was to die. Even though I feel in tune with my life's purpose, the lack of noise in death fulfills a large part of me that life cannot. If I had given myself another twenty-five to thirty years, I could have departed on my deathbed with my head held high and spine erect. But that isn't now. Frankly, a part of me wishes it were. I type this in hopes that maybe it will resonate with someone out there, and know that you aren't alone in feeling this way. 

Thank you for reading this. Have a good day, everyone. ♡",suicidewatch,,Pandora,40.9481079,-83.9610538
All alone. Going to kill myself soon. ,"I'm 62 years old, out of a job, wife sick.  Neglected by daughter. I'm going to kill myself soon. 

They say God will help. He never did. There is no Heaven nor Hell.  No God, no Satan. There is only nothing  after you die. I've seen it after a heart attack in 2018. Just nothing after death.

All my affairs are in order. Just wanted to say goodbye to internet strangers.,"Hi everyone.

Don't worry, I'm not looking for any help.  I'm only here to get this off my chest.  

31yr old male here in the U.S.  My fiancé had an affair, and took our 4year son.  I only get to see him on Wednesdays and every other weekend.  I'm a very ""all or nothing"" kind of person. Same as my parents. As shitty as this may seem, I'd rather be gone that deal with the pain. 

I've spent the last 5 months setting this up, and I'm completely come to terms with my decision.  I always plan ahead, and I have set up a trust account for my son, an email address for him, a 529 account for college, etc.  My Will & last testament has been completed, and letters have been written, all photos have been transferred to hard drive and my apartment packed up and cleaned (lease up in 3 months).  I was even able to cross a few things off my bucket list in the last few months which was nice.

I've got a very discrete spot picked out that me and some friends would go camping at in college, and I've gathered all materials. (A ridiculous amount of heavy pain pills, 3 bottles of prescribed codeine/promethazine cough syrup to prevent throwing up, my favorite alcohol, and old car, and a gun just in case.  A little extreme I know, but I'm not afraid of dying....I'm afraid of surviving. 

I just wanted to thank reddit for always being there.  I'll most likely be painlessly surfing reddit and listening to a few of my favorite songs in my last moments in my car waiting for the carbon monoxide to do its job.

Godspeed",suicidewatch,,U.S.,39.7837304,-100.445882
"Why bother living at all ? Life is just working, being anxious until the day you eventually die, despite knowing that in the end, you'll die anyway. I can't be free in this world. Death is the only way to be freed.","I'll quickly introduce myself. I'm Louis, 18 years old Frenchman, and my life completely changed in the span of 3 months. From being a successful student, having excellent grades and a whole plan for my future, I went to being unmotivated, mentally troubled and in the end unable to being a part of the society. Until September, I always wanted to become someone. Doing great studies, achieving great feats, having a wonderful wife and a beloved family. I had the most human dream possible. The most basic of all. I just wanted to be a normal guy, living my life happy as I've always been, and as I've always thought I would be.

&#x200B;

In September, I've entered one of the best colleges of France, I was excited and ready to succeed. I wanted to give my best, as I've always done before. But since then, I've lost a part of myself. In fact, I've always been someone very rational. Always questioning myself on every little thing that could happen in my life. In my entire life, I think I've spent more time with myself (talking in my head) than anyone else, which I think is not that uncommon. The thing is, I've come to realize that living is just boring as fuck. Living is such a pain, it's ridiculous. And even more than that, it's useless. This message is a way to express my opinion on life, and why I consider it as a burden.

&#x200B;

The first thing I've come to realize when I entered adulthood, is that life is just so repetitive. It's a cycle that never ends. Every day you wake up, every day you eat, every day you work, every day you sleep. So predictable. Every single human being is forced to do these things. And for most, it doesn't even bother them, as it never bothered me before. We just comply because we're used to. It's just normal. But once you just think of it, you feel enslaved. You just need to. You need to, but do I want it ? It doesn't matter. Eat, or you die. Drink, or you die. Work, or you die. The last one is the most important one. In 3 months, I've just come to hate the very concept of working. For me, it's more studying, which was my biggest quality even 3 months ago. I could work hours without any trouble. I would be happy doing it. Because I felt like I had a goal right ? One day, it would all make sense, all this work and devotion ? But will it ever make sense ? In fact, it won't ever make sense. Because you'll be forced to work all your life anyway. You study for degree, then you work for money, then you die. But you need to do it, it's your fate as a human being. Work and shut up. I'm 18, and already bored.

&#x200B;

What I've said is nothing extraordinary. I don't feel like anything special and many must go through the same process. But I don't even comprehend how you can enjoy living anymore. Living is just so absurd, in the sense that we will all die some day. We are all condemned to death the very second we are born. Disappearing is our fate. Dying is our destiny. Why bother living knowing such a terrible truth ? I've read countless forums, and most of the time, people would answer some obvious things like : ""If we're meant to die, then let's enjoy the time we have anyway !"". But that's the most stupid I could ever think of ? Enjoying a life that you know is bound to fade is just deceiving yourself. It’s like putting on the mask that just fell, hiding the reality that you've discovered, acting like it doesn't exist ! I CAN'T DO THAT ! I'll die and I know it ! It takes so much strength to deceive yourself. To enjoy things. To not think. People won't get that. Do people even know that they will die ? I see them smiling, having fun, achieving things. Do they know it won't make any difference ? As a human being, we can't achieve anything great enough that will objectively have sense. Most people have dreams that make them live. Helping others, winning a competition... But it's so fucking fake. You are just a mere human and you will die like everybody else. That I die know or in 70 years, what changes ? I would have lived 70 years of asking myself ""Why ?"" and in the end, it wouldn't have meant anything.

&#x200B;

Achieving on this planet is just an illusion. If you win the World Cup (allez la France !), it doesn't change the fact that you're destined to die. As any species, humans will disappear one day. Everything that is considered as precious by society, and that was once my dream -- having a successful career, having money, founding a family, being virtuous --, it only has value because there are other persons to acknowledge you and the thing you have. Money makes you able to buy pretty much everything in this world because everyone has come to value it highly.

&#x200B;

My point is that life is just a game that doesn't make sense at all. You have nothing to win. People will comply to the rules even without having read them. They just play the game because why not ? We are here, let's play ! But I am here, one of the few that read the rules, and I feel like an outcast. I'm forced to play the game even though I did not ask for it. I am forced to wake up even though I've nothing to win at all. I don't want anything. I don't want money. I don't want a wife. I don't want to work. I don't want to live. The game is rigged and I don't want to play. Everyone acts like everything is so important, but it's just an illusion. Nothing is important in itself. Because us, humans, are just so ridiculously meaningless. Life is meaningless. And unfortunately, I'm not able to accept this reality. I can't avoid it anymore.

&#x200B;

To come back to my personal situation, I've dropped out one month ago. I've broke down before my parents, and they've brought me back home. I feel worse than ever. I have no purpose. My parents, even though they've been very comprehensive, have started to pressure me more and more, as they should do. I'm being humiliated every single time they tell this story to anyone. I've isolated myself to everyone too. I've got no friends. I don't want any. I don't even want to talk to my family. I ghost anyone that sends messages, because I don't want to talk again and again about this miserable situation. I'm so lost. I just want to be free. I don't want to keep doing this bullshit anymore. I have questioned myself about freedom. Can you be free as a human being ? Physically, we are restricted by our bodies. But mentally, as long as you follow your own rules, you're free. I don't think I can be free in this world, as long as I'm alive. My dream is to escape this whole bullshit. But I can't. Maybe I could be free once I die, who knows ?",suicidewatch,,Louis,0.4081713,9.432388

Young doctor (29yo) with suicide thoughts,"First, thank you for opening the post. I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. 

Young male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.

Since school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).

Escaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections. Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice. And NOBODY will employ you at any job in the US if you are not citizen. 5 stupid years wasted + 8 years of home training.

I came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job. I faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here, there are just too many doctors today. I lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available, but then COVID-19 happened. My country is in lockdown, I'm quarantined, unemployed, with no money, no financial power, living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime (paralized temporarily due pandemic), living off the charity of others, unable to move, unable to sleep due suicide thoughts, and writing this. Most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries. I feel like i'm in the starting line. I'm now almost 30 years old, indebted, single and poor. I'm ashamed of what I experienced, I'm ashamed to say I'm unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job, and still hunting for one. I'm a miserable unemployed doctor.

 You want to make it worse? Law in my country requires me to serve in the COVID emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse, totally UNPAID or I could be charged a fine or brief jail time.   

Failure is the word to describe what I am. I hate myself, I constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and I blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of God despite me being religious. Education was in vain in my life. The only thing that prevents me from commiting suicide is my parents, but after I bury them, I think I might take the shot. 

I'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls.

Young doctor (29yo) with suicide thoughts,"First, thank you for opening the post. I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. 

Young male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.

Since school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).

Escaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections.

My Wife Attempted Suicide,"Wednesday afternoon my wife took a massive amount of medication. She texted me a photo of two piles of pills and said ""Goodbye. I'm sorry."" I was at my parents apartment in the same building as ours, so I ran to our apartment, but she locked me out. I beat on the door over and over yelling for her to open up, and when she finally did, she just stumbled across the floor and fell on her bed, gagging and crying. I called 911 and held her head up and tried to keep her awake. She was vomiting everywhere. The paramedics carried her out of the apartment and down to a stretcher and I sped to the ER right behind them. They gave me a number to call in the ER to get updates, and all they kept saying was that she was in very critical condition and they're doing their best to stabilize her. She was vomiting so much that they couldn't pump her stomach and had to put her on a ventilator. Hours went by that felt like days, and the Dr finally called and said that they stabilized her, she was on a ventilator, but with the amount of duloxetine she ingested there was a high chance that she'd either be ""brain dead"" or have brain damage. I fell apart. My dad was there to hold me up, but I felt all the wind leave my lungs. My dad took the phone and talked to the Dr some more and then he picked me up like I was a kid and got me out of there and into the car. He said there's nothing we can do here. She's in ICU, she's gonna pull through, but we're waiting on the CT scan. So he drove us home, I passed out on the couch and at 6am the nurse called to tell us they got her off the ventilator and the scan was negative for brain damage. I threw my clothes on and sped to the hospital and stayed there for 2 days until it was time for her psychological evaluation. They actually said she was of no harm to herself or others and that she didn't require inpatient treatment of any kind. They discharged her to go home. I was speechless. I called her psychiatrist and he was emphatic about her being admitted for psychiatric treatment. She refused and said she just wanted to go home. Now, we have 2 autistic children. I am on short term disability for a migraine that's been going since early May, every day, and I'm not responding to any treatment. My head's a 8/10 on the pain scale nearly every day. I'm seeing a neurologist tomorrow, finally, but I've been at home on bed rest since May 17th with an ice bag on my head. Times are really tough. But now they want her to go home and for me to keep a ""suicide watch"" on her, to keep pills and sharp objects out of her reach. To find her outpatient therapy. To follow up with her psychiatrist and PCP. I can barely make myself a sandwich right now. So we brought her back home and the universe came calling. It was her psychiatrist who she's been seeing for 17 years. He said that if she doesn't follow his medical advice and admit herself to a mental health hospital, then he had no other recourse than to drop her as a patient. At that point, she got up, started getting herself together and said ok find me somewhere to go. I got her admitted to a reputable hospital that her psychiatrist recommended and I haven't heard from her since. I'm lost. I'm stuck between falling apart and angrier than I've ever been in my entire life. And my head is banging...just pounding. I asked my parents to take the kids until this blows over, and all I've been doing is crying, then I stop and get so mad...just furious. Then I break down again. I talked to my therapist and my spiritual advisor and they both helped a lot. But I'm so, so broken. I'm so confused. What did I do to make this happen? I just cry myself to sleep wondering what she's doing and what I'm going to when she comes home. I've never been so scared of something in my life. What if she does this again? What about the kids? They're autistic, they don't understand the complexity of what's going down. What if they find something really wrong with my brain? I feel like I'm standing at the edge of a cliff in the middle of a wind storm, trying to keep my balance, trying to be strong, but knowing that sooner or later I'm going to fall. And everyone is depending on me. And for whatever reason, my wife, my best friend, the mother of my kids, after 14 years together just said ""Goodbye. I'm sorry."" Where the hell do we even go from here?",suicidewatch,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
I wish I could give my life to someone who wants to live,"Sometimes, I wish I could trade places with a terminal cancer patient who is holding onto life as tightly as he can. I do not have any enthusiasm for life, and it seems like a waste. I feel like I am going through the motions, just waiting to die... and it's going to be a long wait. I have been in therapy for 10 years, and it's constantly like this. I wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing.

See, there is nothing in this world that brings me joy. I do not have any hobbies, and I do not have a job. I am going to be evicted if I do not find something before May, and while I have been applying, I also don't see the point. I have this black-and-white image in my head-- like a flipbook-- of me going through the motions until I am older enough to retire. I think I would rather cut to the chase because being alive hurts. There mornings where I wake up and take a handful of sleeping pills to make myself fall asleep again. That's really what I am doing... I am waiting to die.

It kind of feels good to type this out. I have not been out of my apartment for almost two weeks. It's almost like I've forgotten what the sound of my own voice sounds like. My boyfriend recently moved away, and we hardly talk anymore. My therapist dumped me (it's a long story + it was kinda my fault, so dont blame her), so I am without support (or structure). I do not have any friends. My family thinks I am being a drama queen and won't ""play"" this game with me anymore. If I were to kill myself tonight, I wonder how long it would take the world to notice. I imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body starts to smell and a neighbor complains.

I have prescriptions for a whole cocktail of drugs, but I am not 100% certain that an overdose would be successful. I'm 80% sure since I have stimulants and relaxants and sedatives and with some alcohol-- I don't drink, so I image I don't have a lot of tolerance-- it almost feels like I can pull it off. My biggest fear is failing. I am afraid I will only have a seizure and then have to deal with the aftermath of my suicide attempt. God, I don't want to spend more time in a psych ward.

By all rights I should've been three grades above where I was. Public schools like uniformity. Different is anathema to them.

So my second year of middle school I said fuck it and quit going. I wasn't getting anything out of it anyway. Contrary to what most adults and parents think...you can't make a child do anything they don't want to do. They tried to make me go back. I refused. When my father hit me with the belt I called the police on him.

It was the last time that ever happened.

At fifteen or sixteen I got my highschool deploma from a by mail school. Mostly out of spite. It was a waste of time and money.

My general anexity and inability to be what society deems normal kept me from getting a job. Well almost.

I worked for the family construction business starting at age 15 to 21 where I had wrecked my back. 0/10. Would not recommend. Money was great however it destroyed my developing body. I suffer from chromic pain now. Which on good days can be described as an icepick twisting in my hip and a baseball bat smashing into my back...and on bad sees me unable to walk from my bedroom to the bathroom without suffering from muscle spasms.

I digress.

At twenty-five(I think)  I moved across the entire US to get away from them. With my then girlfriend/fiance. In retrospect it was a doomed relationship. While I cared for her my desire to get away from my family mattered more. I had grown to hate them.

I had to come home two years later due to irreconcilable differences. I left again a short time later to be with another girl. At age thirty no less. I've been with this one since. If not for the disability laws we'd be married now.

My life had finally come together. We moved back to help tend to my ailing father. Stage four cancer. It was in 'remission'. or supressed. Whatever they do to keep it undercontrol.

I was healthier. Until I was forced to deal with my toxic wastedump of a family again.

My mother hated my 'wife' and mother inlaw. She resented me for not being there to help with my father. (Yeah fuck you too bitch.) When he first took ill. Mm. She made no secret of that in how she treated me.

In the amidst of all that my grandmother, one who helped raise me...and also swept the abuse under the rug. Died.

When I finally confronted my mother and aunt...my aunt claimed no such thing ever happened to me. So the options are casual indifference or malicious stupidity. The rage I had came back two fold.

Luckily I lived across town. I could be there for my dad...help get him to this appointments and visit...yet I was isolated enough that I didn't have to deal with the excess family shit I tried to escape.

Until 2020.

In this godawful hellscape of a year... I lost my uncle in july. He was one of two male rolemodels I had. He helped instill morals in me and helped raise me.

I lost my house(A rental), because the phrase 'caregiver' went in one ear and out the other. My priority was my dad. So sometimes the lawn wouldn't be cut as often as they would like. Or sometimes the house wouldn't be as clean. Sorry I have priorities. The shitbag landlord told us the neighborhood was becoming gentrified and he wouldn't be renewing our lease at the end of the year.

So unpleasantly I had to move back home with my wife and mother in law. Where my mother finds fault in everything.

Lovely.

A month after I move in my father dies.

Its at this juncture I begin to despise pretty much everyone and everything. I could not, in my wildest dreams imagine life being this goddamned cruel. I thought I'd get another year with him. Instead I got a middle finger.

A week or so before his birthday.

Then the petty fights started over bullshit. They are too numerous to even bother recounting here. Everyday some minor drama.

As if that wasn't enough... One of the kittens I hand raised and tamed had to be put to sleep due to cancer. After I spent 350 dollars I didn't fucking have to try and save her life. It wasn't my cat though. It was my dads. So another kick in the nuts.

This has been my life for the last three months. One blow after another with selfish ignorant people who continue to be absolute douchebags. Fighting over inconsequential shit that no sane person would give a damn about.

The cat dying was the last straw for me. I went off my meds. I was tried of playing peace keeper or being 'the man of the house.'

If I'm going to be miserable, I'm going to be miserable. I'm not going to keep pumping chemical bullshit into me to give me an artificial happy only to have it destroyed by selfish ignorant fucks.

TO make matters worse, the constant snark directed at my wife has her in such a state she doesn't want to do anything. So cleaning, the litterboxes all of it falls on me now. This enviroment is destroying  the one healthy relationship I have. I'm growing to hate her too.

Oh did I mention I'm a firearm owner? I had to stay away from them for years until I trusted myself enough to use them responsibly again. The entire experience has destroyed that. I can't even enjoy one of the few hobbies my dad and I shared.

Years of healing unraveled in a few short months.

I'm a prisoner inside my own mind(And home it feels like)  half the time and the other half Well....I'm getting yelled at for leaving to go buy mcdonals at 11 at night or treated like I'm still a child because apperently I'm supposed to ask permission before leaving.. HAHAHA No.

I've just about had my fill of other peoples bullshit. Though don't mistake me. I'm far too spiteful to actively harm anyone but myself. See if I opt out of this, the people who did nothing but make me miserable will have the guilt of my suicide on their minds. That thought alone makes me smile.

I find myself looking at my dad's 1911 which I carry everyday...wondering why I don't stick the thing in my mouth and pull the trigger.

Even at my lowest I used to have reasons why I wouldn't. Now the reasons why I should vastly out weigh the reasons why I shouldn't.

Now that I have the text here, looking at it... I suppose the only reason I haven't is I'm not convinced the damn thing would actually kill me. The way this shitfuck of a year has gone I'd survive and be wheelchair bound or more mentally damaged than I already am.  There's always the shotgun I suppose...but it doesn't have the same sense of poetic irony to it.

So yeah. Merry Christmas to me.

This will get lost in a sea of Suicide notes,"I’m using this to say exactly how I feel cause I know no one will see this. 

The last time I was genuinely happy was when I was 5.. then my grandfather died. I was extremely close to him and after his death things just weren’t the same, fast forward to 7th grade my father whom I was never close to despite living in the same house decided to slowly leave his family for another family and left my mom and I alone, then my mother took him back which kissed me off and caused me to an angry child who didn’t trust anyone... which probably caused me to never have a real relationship cause I never feel good enough and I can never fully trust them. Anyways I was always socially awkward/ shy and didn’t have a lot of friends but I have 3 childhood best friends I can at least say I have but as we’ve gotten older and everyone is moving on with their lives I feel stuck. 

My life began to really fall apart in the fall of 2017 ( my second year of college) when I began to rapidly lose the vision in my left eye due to a condition I have that I didn’t even know about until the year before but the doctors said I shouldn’t worry to much about it, due to the loss of my vision in that eye I had 2 eye surgeries to try and repair it but they didn’t work which shocked the doctors. I took a semester off of school to recover and came back in hopes to finish school, then in February of this year the vision in my right eye began to slowly go away. I had to quit my job and leave school and move back in with my parents to try to “ heal”..

I eventually got a job ( which I hate with a passion) and became stuck... then I got into a car accident and totaled my car so now I’m carless. I want to go back to school and get a new car but I feel like what’s the point if I won’t be able to see in a few months, everyday when I wake up before I open my eyes I think “ am I going to be able to even see”. It sucks because surgery won’t work, I’ve tried the holistic approach too and I’m still just slowly losing my sight. I really took things like that for granted.  My parents put me in therapy and it has caused me to face things but with my looking at the bigger picture I’m like what’s really the point? 


I’ll have 3 days of me feeling like myself and”happy” then it’ll be weeks of me in a deep depression wanting to kill my self or hoping I’ll die. I told my mother I want to kill myself before I go completely blind because I couldn’t live like that ( respect to those that are blind and live cause y’all are strong.. even though y’all can’t see this) so I said I’m going to see how the rest of the year plays out cause I’m not going into 2020 like this, but it’s like when I try to get my shit together nothing goes right, I had my heart set out for this new job and everyone there was like you got the job, the supervisors liked you, the employees recommended you, etc... no call back ( I was supposed to get one yesterday if I got the job) that was my breaking point. 

That job really was a push for me to keep going but now that I didn’t get it I feel stuck again, I feel like I sound stupid and dramatic and I know this is worded horribly but I guess I’m just writing my jumbled thoughts out. I’ve been looking up easy ways to kill myself but I’ve seen that there are none... if I had a gun I’d just shoot myself, I looked up ODing on pills but it’s hit or miss and the miss will fuck you up, I thought about hanging myself but I’m black and I’d feel weird idk lol, I think about driving into oncoming traffic and hoping I’ll die but I don’t want to total my dads car cause that’s his property, I thought about cutting myself but I’ve read that that’s a slow death. 

It’s like why is it so hard to die when you want to but when life is going good then you get sick, or die, etc. I guess I sound like a bitch cause I want to die but I don’t want to feel any pain but I guess I’ll have to feel pain in the process cause afterwards they’ll be no more pain. There’s like so much going on in my head and so much to write but idek what to say tbh even though I already said a lot, all in all I’m just so tired. Tired of crying myself to sleep, crying to work, crying at work, crying alone at home, and crying myself to sleep. I’ve been trying to disconnect myself from people but it’s like I still crave human interaction that’s why I feel like a fraud cause I want to be alone but I don’t to feel alone. 

This whole thing probably doesn’t even make any sense but I’m just writing out my thoughts. No one will see this anyways or even read all of this anyways. At first I was giving myself till the end of the year but now I’m just trying to find the best method to end it.",suicidewatch,,Suicide,39.384541096056786,-106.7045625418667
idk what to do,my best friend told me hes bipolar recently.i dont know if he takes medicine for it but i kno hes also been depressed for almost 2 years and talks to a therapist.we barely talk now he started leaving me on delivered for hours while actively talking to his ex (technically i am an ex of him too..) playing roblox tg and idk.were teenagers forgot to mention that.im really confused because in january he broke up with that girl right and he said he misses me sm.we dated last year for almost 3 weeks he ended things but i lowkey understand him his mental health is still bad and the fact his friends started making fun of him for dating me (hes 2yrs older thats why) rlly affected him.after almost 2 months he started dating that girl since january last year theyve dated at least 3 times because of how much they argue and how bad she treated him.idk why he decided he even wants to date her again but whatever until like march we were texting sm acting all lovey dovey i genuinely think it could work out between us i try to be as understanding as possible because his parents are also divorcing and i dont wanna hurt him but the fact he randomly started ignoring me and taking to his ex again after he told her he doesnt love her anymore and i make him feel loved and wtv crushes me.idk what to do is him pushing me away normal? im aware of the fact she hurt him so much i ofc dont understand how he feels but i dont get why he complains to me about how they still argue yet hes clearly willing to talk to her.i think it happened in the end of february they argued and she was apparently rude to him and he told me he would never love or trust someone like that again.tho a few weeks ago he started flirting with me again sometimes we talk a lot then again he randomly disappears for hours.when we were tg  he was rly sweet hes still respectful and whatever hes my bsfs i cant Imagine my life without him.idk what else to say but any advice is appreciated im sorry for how messed up i write im just on the edge of ending it.,depression,,Imagine,51.7605749,19.486936634011112
I'VE GIVEN UP ON LIFE,"ATP I feel like I'm cursed and my life is destined for disaster...I'm a f22 staying in an environment that is very toxic to the point my own mother isn't talking to me. My parents divorced when I was 11years old because my father was an abusive man and I had to convince my mother to leave otherwise she would have been dead. My mother has been the only parent in my life helping me and my sister with everything whilst on the other hand my dad has literally been a dead beat who continued on with his abusive nature and married twice the first after my mother didn't work out because he was extremely abusive and beat up the wife to the point where she lost her baby and the second wife he started seeing her during his marriage to the other wife and got her pregnant and now she has 3 kids by him but he relocated to go to the UK which was my idea first during the time when they used to take a lot of people from different African countries to be healthcare assistants in the UK but he discouraged me not to go because apparently life in the UK is not easy but he ended up going using all my ideas and how I wanted to relocate and he's been going between his wife with 3 kids and his new girlfriend in the UK. He barely visited us when he was still staying in the same country as us but he affords to catch flights and visit 2year old twins who will barely remember him from the 3rd wife...so life after my parents divorce was tough and it pushed me to grow up quickly and if there are any Africans here they understand what I'm talking about. I had to be the mother my little sister didn't have and literally everything our household needed (the mechanic for our car, the maid, the gardener, the fast thinker) my mother was going through great depression at the time and I had to make sure that we pulled through and I did as she didn't want to talk to anyone and she'd stay in her room for hours sometimes putting the TV on and just staring at it even until the movie finishes without even processing or watching the movie but she eventually got out of it. Over the years that role has stuck with me being the literal parent to both my mother and sister but now I'm tired infact I've been tired a long time ago because I never experienced being a child and it took a toll on me to the point that I've tried committing suicide 8 times since I was 14. From 14 my mums mood swings started and all the rage and anger she felt for my father and even any situation she'd take it out on me and my sister always got the better end of the bargain because my mum would always baby her saying she needs most of the love as she was just 6 or 7 years when my parents divorced so she never experienced a father figure in her life. My mums relationships have been toxic to the point that she had a live in boyfriend who got her pregnant and she had a still birth but when the boyfriend discovered that my mum was pregnant he left her and she went into depression so I had to take care of her during the course of her pregnancy and I ended up now sleeping on the floor in her room and doing everything for her especially in winter her pregnancy was very demanding I'd wake up at 2am daily to make tea for her then if she wanted more blankets or socks or woolen hats I'd make sure that I'd fix everything for her but it started to take a toll on my mental health and I'd leave for school at 4am and walk alone with my thoughts and I was 16 at this time waiting to write my O level exams. I thought that after the baby was born everything was going to be fine but I wasn't even ready for the mountain that came after...my mother had a still birth at 9 months. When her boyfriend left we promised we'd take care of the baby especially me so that my mother wouldn't worry but she lost the baby and the aftermath was worse than I could ever imagine, she suffered another phase of great depression to the point where she would refuse to eat or bath and I'd do that for her and I'd still leave for school at 4am but when I'd reach school I'd start thinking about why I left home early and I should go back and be there for my mother because if she dies we have no one to take care of us. It was bad to the point that her stitches started to rot and I had to start cleaning her stitches and forcing to put medicine on them so that they heal down there and it was horrific. She would overdose medication and at one point I thought that I'd loose her but she made it. We didn't watch TV for a whole year and when we started to watch TV again we'd make sure we prewatch the movies and it would be anything without children and this happened for another year. Yes I failed my exams of course and O level results are really important especially in Africa for a person to do a meaningful course. I proceeded to go to A level and my mum  got back with the boyfriend who got her pregnant and the house was tense and it was horrible living in that environment because I had so much anger towards the man but I kept it inside and he came back with the act that he wanted to make things right and marry my mum but she fell for it and in total they dated for 7years until last year when they broke up finally I hope because she started to realize that this man wasn't going to marry her and in Africa being a single mother is shamed upon so that's why she was soooo hopeful that she'd get married and regain respect especially from her siblings. When covid happened that was the same year I was supposed to write my A level Cambridge exams but I wasn't able to the 2021 my mum came out of the blues and said that I should write my exams but I hadn't been going to school for a whole year and I wasn't doing any lessons so I ended up failing my exams again. After that whole period I've spent 4years at home I tried doing a nurse aide course so that I can go work in the UK and then study my way into becoming a nurse whilst paying for myself because I would have lessened the burden for my mum and she'd focus on my little sister so I passed with Honours and did my ielts and passed with a 7.0 band score and all these I studied on my own and did it but I failed to get a sponsor or a certificate of sponsorship to be able to work in the UK so I told my dad I needed help with talking to my grandmother to take me on her visa as she is already a UK citizen and can bring anyone as long as we use the same surname but my dad refused and instead took my whole idea and went to the UK which is where he's now living. His parents and his siblings all stay there and went when I was about 2years so if they wanted to help me they would but we don't have a close relationship so now my mum wants me to follow my passion and be a makeup artist but the fees for internationally recognized certificates are expensive and the friction we have is that all these years I've been the one telling her when the nurse aide program started I told her before a lot of countries were being red listed so that I do the course but she never saw the seriousness until her friend and children left that's when the insults came and I would start being called names and every insult and that I'm not serious with life and I'm a looser just like my father. Then I came up to her with the second idea of getting my makeup certificate and working on cruiseships but again my idea was shut down until now and then the insults started that I'm not serious with life and I'm going to end up a nobody in life just like my father and to make matters worse my little sister is starting university soon and now she thinks I'm in competition with her and that's why I am pushing for me to leave but I've honestly wanted to leave for the longest because of our living environment and people who look from the outside think we have a good life but now everything is getting worse because she's now dating a boy close to my age and she goes out almost every night after work and when she comes back home I have to make sure she's okay and if she's drunk I have to be helping her and it's been taking a toll on me and my life. My sister is happy to be leaving for university because of everything that's been happening but my mum doesn't want me to leave because even when the nurse aide thing failed she said to me maybe it's God who made you not go because he knows I need you but I'm tired I need my own life. End of 2024 I had two mild strokes and almost died and now I'm on bp medication and a bunch of other heart medication and I feel like all this has been pushed to this point because of the stresses in my life and if I try to talk to my Mum she shouts at me and makes me the bad guy to the point where now she's not talking to me. It's been 3 days of her not talking to me. I have had high blood pressure since 11 when my parents divorced but now it's getting worse and even on the meds it sometimes is still extremely high. I'm tired of everything, I have really tried but I'm tired. I just want to die. I didn't even write everything but just a small part so you guys could understand. I am tired of living, yes as a Christian I shouldn't be thinking like this but honestly I'm tired. I tried a lot of things like writing to organisations that help the less privileged so that I can get assistance in becoming a makeup artist or beauty therapist but everything has proven in vain so I'm ready to throw the towel.

My mother has been the only parent in my life helping me and my sister with everything whilst on the other hand my dad has literally been a dead beat who continued on with his abusive nature and married twice the first after my mother didn't work out because he was extremely abusive and beat up the wife to the point where she lost her baby and the second wife he started seeing her during his marriage to the other wife and got her pregnant and now she has 3 kids by him but he relocated to go to the UK which was my idea first during the time when they used to take a lot of people from different African countries to be healthcare assistants in the UK but he discouraged me not to go because apparently life in the UK is not easy but he ended up going using all my ideas and how I wanted to relocate and he's been going between his wife with 3 kids and his new girlfriend in the UK. He barely visited us when he was still staying in the same country as us but he affords to catch flights and visit 2year old twins who will barely remember him from the 3rd wife...so life after my parents divorce was tough and it pushed me to grow up quickly and if there are any Africans here they understand what I'm talking about. I had to be the mother my little sister didn't have and literally everything our household needed (the mechanic for our car, the maid, the gardener, the fast thinker) my mother was going through great depression at the time and I had to make sure that we pulled through and I did as she didn't want to talk to anyone and she'd stay in her room for hours sometimes putting the TV on and just staring at it even until the movie finishes without even processing or watching the movie but she eventually got out of it. Over the years that role has stuck with me being the literal parent to both my mother and sister but now I'm tired infact I've been tired a long time ago because I never experienced being a child and it took a toll on me to the point that I've tried committing suicide 8 times since I was 14. From 14 my mums mood swings started and all the rage and anger she felt for my father and even any situation she'd take it out on me and my sister always got the better end of the bargain because my mum would always baby her saying she needs most of the love as she was just 6 or 7 years when my parents divorced so she never experienced a father figure in her life. My mums relationships have been toxic to the point that she had a live in boyfriend who got her pregnant and she had a still birth but when the boyfriend discovered that my mum was pregnant he left her and she went into depression so I had to take care of her during the course of her pregnancy and I ended up now sleeping on the floor in her room and doing everything for her especially in winter her pregnancy was very demanding I'd wake up at 2am daily to make tea for her then if she wanted more blankets or socks or woolen hats I'd make sure that I'd fix everything for her but it started to take a toll on my mental health and I'd leave for school at 4am and walk alone with my thoughts and I was 16 at this time waiting to write my O level exams. I thought that after the baby was born everything was going to be fine but I wasn't even ready for the mountain that came after...my mother had a still birth at 9 months. When her boyfriend left we promised we'd take care of the baby especially me so that my mother wouldn't worry but she lost the baby and the aftermath was worse than I could ever imagine, she suffered another phase of great depression to the point where she would refuse to eat or bath and I'd do that for her and I'd still leave for school at 4am but when I'd reach school I'd start thinking about why I left home early and I should go back and be there for my mother because if she dies we have no one to take care of us. It was bad to the point that her stitches started to rot and I had to start cleaning her stitches and forcing to put medicine on them so that they heal down there and it was horrific. She would overdose medication and at one point I thought that I'd loose her but she made it. We didn't watch TV for a whole year and when we started to watch TV again we'd make sure we prewatch the movies and it would be anything without children and this happened for another year. Yes I failed my exams of course and O level results are really important especially in Africa for a person to do a meaningful course. I proceeded to go to A level and my mum  got back with the boyfriend who got her pregnant and the house was tense and it was horrible living in that environment because I had so much anger towards the man but I kept it inside and he came back with the act that he wanted to make things right and marry my mum but she fell for it and in total they dated for 7years until last year when they broke up finally I hope because she started to realize that this man wasn't going to marry her and in Africa being a single mother is shamed upon so that's why she was soooo hopeful that she'd get married and regain respect especially from her siblings. When covid happened that was the same year I was supposed to write my A level Cambridge exams but I wasn't able to the 2021 my mum came out of the blues and said that I should write my exams but I hadn't been going to school for a whole year and I wasn't doing any lessons so I ended up failing my exams again. After that whole period I've spent 4years at home I tried doing a nurse aide course so that I can go work in the UK and then study my way into becoming a nurse whilst paying for myself because I would have lessened the burden for my mum and she'd focus on my little sister so I passed with Honours and did my ielts and passed with a 7.0 band score and all these I studied on my own and did it but I failed to get a sponsor or a certificate of sponsorship to be able to work in the UK so I told my dad I needed help with talking to my grandmother to take me on her visa as she is already a UK citizen and can bring anyone as long as we use the same surname but my dad refused and instead took my whole idea and went to the UK which is where he's now living. His parents and his siblings all stay there and went when I was about 2years so if they wanted to help me they would but we don't have a close relationship so now my mum wants me to follow my passion and be a makeup artist but the fees for internationally recognized certificates are expensive and the friction we have is that all these years I've been the one telling her when the nurse aide program started I told her before a lot of countries were being red listed so that I do the course but she never saw the seriousness until her friend and children left that's when the insults came and I would start being called names and every insult and that I'm not serious with life and I'm a looser just like my father. Then I came up to her with the second idea of getting my makeup certificate and working on cruiseships but again my idea was shut down until now and then the insults started that I'm not serious with life and I'm going to end up a nobody in life just like my father and to make matters worse my little sister is starting university soon and now she thinks I'm in competition with her and that's why I am pushing for me to leave but I've honestly wanted to leave for the longest because of our living environment and people who look from the outside think we have a good life but now everything is getting worse because she's now dating a boy close to my age and she goes out almost every night after work and when she comes back home I have to make sure she's okay and if she's drunk I have to be helping her and it's been taking a toll on me and my life. My sister is happy to be leaving for university because of everything that's been happening but my mum doesn't want me to leave because even when the nurse aide thing failed she said to me maybe it's God who made you not go because he knows I need you but I'm tired I need my own life. End of 2024 I had two mild strokes and almost died and now I'm on bp medication and a bunch of other heart medication and I feel like all this has been pushed to this point because of the stresses in my life and if I try to talk to my Mum she shouts at me and makes me the bad guy to the point where now she's not talking to me. It's been 3 days of her not talking to me. I have had high blood pressure since 11 when my parents divorced but now it's getting worse and even on the meds it sometimes is still extremely high. I'm tired of everything, I have really tried but I'm tired. I just want to die. I didn't even write everything but just a small part so you guys could understand. I am tired of living, yes as a Christian I shouldn't be thinking like this but honestly I'm tired. I tried a lot of things like writing to organisations that help the less privileged so that I can get assistance in becoming a makeup artist or beauty therapist but everything has proven in vain so I'm ready to throw the towel. I'm tired of everything. ",depression,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525

I'VE GIVEN UP ON LIFE,"ATP I feel like I'm cursed and my life is destined for disaster...I'm a f22 staying in an environment that is very toxic to the point my own mother isn't talking to me. My parents divorced when I was 11years old because my father was an abusive man and I had to convince my mother to leave otherwise she would have been dead. My mother has been the only parent in my life helping me and my sister with everything whilst on the other hand my dad has literally been a dead beat who continued on with his abusive nature and married twice the first after my mother didn't work out because he was extremely abusive and beat up the wife to the point where she lost her baby and the second wife he started seeing her during his marriage to the other wife and got her pregnant and now she has 3 kids by him but he relocated to go to the UK which was my idea first during the time when they used to take a lot of people from different African countries to be healthcare assistants in the UK but he discouraged me not to go because apparently life in the UK is not easy but he ended up going using all my ideas and how I wanted to relocate and he's been going between his wife with 3 kids and his new girlfriend in the UK. He barely visited us when he was still staying in the same country as us but he affords to catch flights and visit 2year old twins who will barely remember him from the 3rd wife...so life after my parents divorce was tough and it pushed me to grow up quickly and if there are any Africans here they understand what I'm talking about. I had to be the mother my little sister didn't have and literally everything our household needed (the mechanic for our car, the maid, the gardener, the fast thinker) my mother was going through great depression at the time and I had to make sure that we pulled through and I did as she didn't want to talk to anyone and she'd stay in her room for hours sometimes putting the TV on and just staring at it even until the movie finishes without even processing or watching the movie but she eventually got out of it. Over the years that role has stuck with me being the literal parent to both my mother and sister but now I'm tired infact I've been tired a long time ago because I never experienced being a child and it took a toll on me to the point that I've tried committing suicide 8 times since I was 14. From 14 my mums mood swings started and all the rage and anger she felt for my father and even any situation she'd take it out on me and my sister always got the better end of the bargain because my mum would always baby her saying she needs most of the love as she was just 6 or 7 years when my parents divorced so she never experienced a father figure in her life. My mums relationships have been toxic to the point that she had a live in boyfriend who got her pregnant and she had a still birth but when the boyfriend discovered that my mum was pregnant he left her and she went into depression so I had to take care of her during the course of her pregnancy and I ended up now sleeping on the floor in her room and doing everything for her especially in winter her pregnancy was very demanding I'd wake up at 2am daily to make tea for her then if she wanted more blankets or socks or woolen hats I'd make sure that I'd fix everything for her but it started to take a toll on my mental health and I'd leave for school at 4am and walk alone with my thoughts and I was 16 at this time waiting to write my O level exams. I thought that after the baby was born everything was going to be fine but I wasn't even ready for the mountain that came after...my mother had a still birth at 9 months. When her boyfriend left we promised we'd take care of the baby especially me so that my mother wouldn't worry but she lost the baby and the aftermath was worse than I could ever imagine, she suffered another phase of great depression to the point where she would refuse to eat or bath and I'd do that for her and I'd still leave for school at 4am but when I'd reach school I'd start thinking about why I left home early and I should go back and be there for my mother because if she dies we have no one to take care of us. It was bad to the point that her stitches started to rot and I had to start cleaning her stitches and forcing to put medicine on them so that they heal down there and it was horrific. She would overdose medication and at one point I thought that I'd loose her but she made it. We didn't watch TV for a whole year and when we started to watch TV again we'd make sure we prewatch the movies and it would be anything without children and this happened for another year. Yes I failed my exams of course and O level results are really important especially in Africa for a person to do a meaningful course. I proceeded to go to A level and my mum  got back with the boyfriend who got her pregnant and the house was tense and it was horrible living in that environment because I had so much anger towards the man but I kept it inside and he came back with the act that he wanted to make things right and marry my mum but she fell for it and in total they dated for 7years until last year when they broke up finally I hope because she started to realize that this man wasn't going to marry her and in Africa being a single mother is shamed upon so that's why she was soooo hopeful that she'd get married and regain respect especially from her siblings.

Depression feels like it never ends,"I've been depressed since I was 11. I'm 23 now. I've been medicated for the last 3/4 years, and it's been awesome. I love meds. But regardless, I feel like depression never fully goes away. I feel like I'm always just getting through life, and recently I feel like I did before I got medicated. My life is just so shit that no meds can fix how bad it is. I can't clean my apartment. I'm a grad student and work 60+ hours a week, and come home exhausted. I haven't done any of my hobbies is ages. I can't feed myself, I can't do my laundry, I hate my apartment, I hate my clothes. Everyone at work is pushing me harder and harder and I have nothing left to give. I'm exhausted. I can't keep doing this. I cry every single day, and I just drag myself around constantly. I don't want to die but I want to disappear, to just vanish and live my life in some shadows doing whatever I want undisturbed. I know the depression never fully goes away, but I need it to be kept at bay.  ",depression,,bay.  ,30.2481693,-85.6593633
I hate my life,"I’m 54. 
Looking back over the past years my life has been a domino of disasters each becoming a stronger tornado ripping my world apart leaving me with less and less to start over. 

Here’s my life in an outline:
1. First memory of my mom: “I hate you . I wish you has never been born”
2. I’m a straight A student with so much potential and love for life
3. My narcissistic abusive mother beat me down and destroyed my self esteem. 
4. I graduate with honors and major in biological engineering 
5. Stupidity I changed to architecture. This career has been a disaster. Low salaries. Multiple layoffs from 911, the bubble burst, and COVID. 
6. In college I got pregnant in my 3rd year of architecture school by my boyfriend of 3 years I was deeply in love with. 
7. When we found out I was pregnant he said “don’t expect me to marry you .”
8. He was cheating on me and I found out he had started using cocaine. 
9. I’m a single mom with no support trying to finish college ALONE!
10. After graduation a guy that was my best friend and had been since we started college together wanted us to make a go for a relationship. 
11. It was wonderful
12. He wanted me and my daughter to move to the city he had moved to so we could take our relationship to the next level: marriage. 
13. He wasn’t just a boyfriend. He was my best friend. 
14. I move. We get married in December.
15. February the following year he says “this marriage isn’t what I thought it was going to be. I want a divorce.”
16. March: me and my daughter come home to an empty house. He moved out. Wouldn’t talk to me or answer the phone. 
17. I’m served divorce papers at my new job where everyone knew I moved there to marry him. 
18. 2 years go by and he realizes it was a mistake and wants to marry again. 
19. We do. And vowed never to say the “d” word.
20. We had almost 10 great years. Best decade of my life. We went hiking, camping, kayaking, star gazing, and many more wonderful times. 
21. 8 years later he becomes full of anger and rage. The D word comes back. He would get in my face and yell at me calling me a liar… 
22. Second divorce 
23. Time goes by and I meet a guy. We hit it off. Dated. Got married. We had a baby. After the baby was born the abuse began. It was violent. He threatened to kill me if I left him. I had to get an order of protection. I divorced him. His family is extremely wealthy. He said “I’m going to make sure you are financially devastated and loose your job.” My current employer was friends of his parents. 
24. Divorce cost over $25,000 
25. 4 months after our divorce was final I was fired. 
26. I take a job in my hometown. 
27. My mom tells me she wants to help me get on my feet and I can move into her home. It was empty. She was going to sell it. She married a great guy who had a home in the country. Instead of selling I could live there, pay the mortgage, when I was financially ready buy the house from her. 
28. When I  start to move in she tells me “I’m moving back in my house. I took a job nearby and do not want to drive from the country. You and your daughter can take one of the bedrooms. 
29. What am I going to do with my stuff?
30. It was decided that My now grown first daughter would move into my home and I would leave my things there. 
31. My mom sells the house and gives me less than 2 weeks notice to find a place to live. 
32. I want to move back into my home where all my things are. 
33. That created a huge family riff. 
34. I conceded and moved into a mold infested dump. I  had no furniture and had to once again start over. 
35. I was evicted because I found black mold in the apartment and brought it to my landlords attention. 
36. I had to scramble and find a place to live. A studio apartment. 
37. I move from there to a 2 bedroom. 
38. My grown daughter needs help- she’s a single mom, I get a townhouse for us to live together in to help her. 
39. She trashed it. Wouldn’t pay rent or help with the bills. When the lease was up my rent went up $400/month. I had to find a new place to live and it wasn’t working with my daughter. 
40. I move into a nice rental house
41. I loose my job from COVID
42. I find a remote job luckily. 
43. Finally feeling like I’m crawling out of the dark hole. 
44. My ex starts a custody battle to take custody away from my daughter. 
45. $25,000 again in legal fees. 
46. Reunited with a friend from architecture school I had known for 30 years. 
47. We date for 2 years. Decide to take the next step in our relationship. We  move to his location - I take my remote job with me. 
48. We marry
49. It’s been a mental battle of depression and anxiety 
50. He tells me frequently “this isn’t going to work. We need to figure something out and go our separate ways. 
51. The house is in his name. He bought it before we were married. 
52. Leaving again: I have nothing to start over with. 
53. I started a new job that increased my salary by 65%. I hate it. It’s extremely stressful with intense deadlines.

So from 49 to 53 is where I am now. 

I’m done. This life has SUCKED! 

I have nothing. No retirement. I live with an emotionally abusive husband. I’m on eggshells every day. His sons act like shits to me and my daughter now 13. 

54. 
That’s my life’s legacy.

Edit:
I forgot to add that in 2016 I was diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia. 

The most painful nerve disorder there is. It causes excruciating facial pain that can be triggered by a breeze on your face, brushing your teeth, washing your face, talking , eating, anything that touches any part of your face that nerve touches. I’m on several meds to keep it under control. For the most part it’s livable with medication but it’s always there. 

From the web:
Trigeminal neuralgia (try-JEM-ih-nul nu-RAL-juh) is a condition that causes intense pain similar to an electric shock on one side of the face. It affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries signals from the face to the brain. Even light touch from brushing your teeth or putting on makeup may trigger a jolt of pain. Trigeminal neuralgia can be long-lasting. It's known as a chronic pain condition.

It's called the ""Suicide Disease"" because it causes unbearable pain in the face and temples. It's often triggered by everyday things like brushing teeth, shaving, or putting on makeup. In many cases, the culprit is an out-of-place blood vessel that.

Yeah. 

Add that in to all of the above.

Becky lives with her mother's cousin (her guardian) since her mother died when Becky was 9 and she's been through alot and is very mature due to that. She gets along with older people like me and her sister(32) more than kids her own age.

Within the last 6-8 months she has befriended Joe because he also had severe depression as a child so he ""gets her"", I'm not okay with any of this. They go on day snowboarding trips alone, he's taken her driving and she sat on his lap(because ""she's short""???). They even have plans to see a movie tomorrow night together. Becky is gay and thinks everything is 100% platonic and that Joe is like an older brother. She says nothing has ever happened and she would throw a fit and scream if he ever tried anything and I 100% believe that but it's him I am worried about.

Last night I found out that when he comes over to see our family friend he says hi to Becky and checks in with her and they usually talk (with the door open). Last night he left at 5am because he ""fell asleep in Becky's room.

Again, Becky doesnt see anything wrong and I believe nothing (besides sitting on his lap driving) has happened but that doesn't mean nothing WILL happen! Advice?

"it will be long, I'm sorry","hi, so...there's a situation. before I'll start - english is not my first language, so sorry if my sentences sounds weird or aren't correct grammatically. 

so. for many years now i think that I'm depressed, but there are things that make me feel like I'm imagining things or something, i don't even know. because i feel things that depressed people feel - i have no strength to do basic things, i struggle to even brush my teeth and i need to prepare myself for taking a stupid shower. i just don't have strength and motivation to do anything. i have huge problems with my sleep and i can't eat normally. not because I'm trying to starve myself, i just literally don't have strength for eating and sometimes i even forget about it until I suddenly feel weak. and if i actually want to eat something, i have problems to pick anything because i have no appetite, so at the end i still eat little, but i guess that it doesn't matter since i don't want to actually starve myself and when I'm REALLY hungry then i can force myself to eat even stupid cereals. 

my condition in general is terrible and I'm tired by everything I'm doing, even 8 hours in work is twice harder than it should be. and when I'm finishing something that basic like cleaning the house, then I'm very proud of myself and i feel like i just did a great work. I'm also very often thinking about basic depression things like 'is there a point?' or 'I am useless and pathetic, why I am even here if i am a failure in everything?' and other things like that. I also have a lot of emotional rollercoasters and I can start crying suddenly without any reason at all, and when I have the reason then I can't control my emotions and I'm starting crying even in public and humiliating myself in the process (I'm an adult, so I should control my emotions in public, that's so embarrassing). I also have a lot of issues about my self-worth and one day I think that maybe I'm not that bad when i managed to do something good and I even look nice, but then next day I think that I'm absolutely worthless, useless and ugly. 

I didn't mention a lot of things, but in general - I'm a wreck, yeah. but the point of this post if not to whine and complaining, and I'm sorry if I did it unintentionally, I'm just trying to explain everything the best i can. the point is, that I don't have one huge part of depression - I am not suicidal. actually quite opposite, I have a really big and serious phobia of death, I can have a panic attack even just because I started to think that one day I will die and disappear, that everything will not just go dark and I'll wake up later, but that I will literally disappear and I won't even be able to hear my thoughts or have another life, that I will just stop existing. even while writing these few stupid words I have tears in my eyes and I started breathing heavier. and I also appreciate a lot of things in life, and while I hate a lot of dumb and awful people and how cruel this word is, I see and love a lot of things that good humans made or beautiful things that nature made. and I am literally paranoid about everything that can take my life. and everything can take our life, so my life is a one big paranoia, a lot of small phobias is connected to this one big phobia. I'm afraid of a LOT of things and everything is stressing me, and even making me think about stupid scenarios like ""what if i would just have a car crash?"" or ""what if someone would just want to kidnap me or hurt me?""

I'm trying to function in a society since I have to, but I'm stressed about everything, even basic things like driving a car or walking alone by the street (I'm a woman so i actually have reasons to be afraid of walking alone, so it doesn't help my paranoia). of course, I'm doing all of this, I'm not sitting all days locked in my room just because life stressing me out and is exhausting. I'm trying to live, I'm trying really hard and I'm constantly crossing my comfort zone, almost everyday. even if everything is a huge effort for me, like every single thing, I'm still fighting everyday to just live and not ruin my life more than it's ruined already. 

and I'm really confused is what I have is depression or if I'm just pathetic or something, I don't know how to even describe that, i don't know how to think about myself. I had a therapy once, I was...surprise, who would have thought...scared, to go to a therapy since it could take my money without a reason (if that wouldn't help) and on top of that, my father was mocking me about even needing therapy. but I tried, so I had a therapy for a whole year. and yes, it didn't help. I think that maybe I found a not really good therapist, but I tried to trust her since she was all the time really nice and seemed like she wanted to help. but when I talked to her about my depression, she said that I can't have depression since I told her before about many things I appreciate in life, that I'm determined to live and that I'm full of excitement about my passions, and that she don't see it in me. I thought that - well, okay, she's a specialist in her job, I am not, so maybe i am just utterly pathetic and that there's no help for me. I literally don't know what's wrong with me. 

I recently started to think that I also probably have adhd on top of all that, since from what I read in the internet (not just few articles, i read a lot about that, mostly about real experiences from people that actually have diagnosed adhd) everything seems to suits me, and everything i read abouts experiences of people with adhd i think ""oh, yeah, that's me!"" and ""oh, that explains a lot, yeah, that's also me!"". unfortunately when i was during therapy i didn't suspended adhd yet i didn't tried to be diagnosed with it. yet. i was more focused on what's wrong with me and i wanted to have anything that would make me feel like i know what's going on. but eh, all months of therapy was almost useless. like yeah, it was nice to talk about my problems with someone who can tell me more than ""I'm sorry to hear that"", but it didn't actually helped me in anything. and i didn't even received any diagnoses, which was the main thing i wanted when i came there. i resigned after a year and now i don't have any therapy even if I'm aware that I should. i don't have great work and I'm not rich, i prefer to spend every salary on more important things like food, tickets on train since i don't have my job in the same city i live in, and all other basic needs or things that makes me happy and I'm passionate about, since it helps me to have at least a bit of joy when i feel like sh*t (idk if i can swear here so I'll censor). i just can't afford a therapy, and yeah, i know, maybe if i would try harder, started putting aside part of my salary, stopped buying some less important things like these about my passions...then probably I could afford a therapy. but. I'm reluctant to even try, since it didn't work last time, and happened exactly what i was scared about - i spend my money without a reason, I didn't felt like anything changed and even after a year I felt like everything is the same and that wasting my money on that was pointless.

and honestly i don't think that it will have sense even in the future. like, I know that I'm struggling and my life is sh*t, that I'm a failure and all that, but there's no point. I don't think that my phobia of death will be healed, even if I would try. that's something that just won't go away and it will be with me until my last moment, because that's something that I won't escape. there's a lot of phobias, like darkness or bugs, and healing them is possible, because that's something we can work on. but death? how I can work on that? I can't. that's something that will happen and this paranoia about that will be with me always. I know that the only one thing I can do about that is accept it, and embrace something that is just as natural as being born. but the point of this phobia is that I literally can't. maybe in the future? I still hope that my life will be better someday, and I hope that if it will happen, then my phobia will be less destructive. since maybe I finally will be happy one day, and in that case, maybe my phobia even if still being there, will be just a part of me that will make me helpless and scared sometimes, but not causing panic attacks. but for now, it's strong and a bit ruining my life. I mean, there's a lot of things that's ruining my life. but I just have the impression that this one phobia is a main thing and every other phobias are just a result of this one phobia. 

and besides any phobias, if I have adhd and depression, that's another things that's making my life a lot harder than it's already and if i really have adhd then that's also a thing that was making my life harder since i was a kid. because yes, I was struggling even as a little dumb kid, always being hyperactive, having problems with concentration, and struggling for every one year of my whole education since I always had a lot of problems with learning and I needed to try harder than other kids to understand basic things in school. and I always needed more creative and stimulating ways to understand things better and to be actually interested in them. and I won't even talk about how terrible is my memory and how much I was upset at myself that I just can't remember things and that I need to spend so much time on learning stuff, and that even if I actually knew something, it often just disappeared from my mind in the moment I looked at the test. just great that no one suspended that maybe I have adhd and that no one decided to make my life easier and check if maybe I'm not just stupid. because like...I think a lot of awful things about myself, and maybe NOW I am stupid, but I clearly remember that as a kid I was reading a lot of books and when I was actually passionate about some subjects and when I was learning things in a more creative and stimulating ways, then I was able to learn a lot of interesting things and actually remember them. I remember how passionate I was as a little kid about cosmos, planets, stars and stuff like that. I was reading a lot of science books about that and even my parents was buying me science books about cosmos and stars on my birthdays apart of some dolls. but well, then somehow I went to school and barely passed a math test after learing a whole week for this sh*t. what a stupid kid, hmm, interesting if maybe something is wrong. nah, probably just stupid kid.

ANYWAY.

the point of this post was just to explain my situation and ask you guys if you think that I have depression since I'm not suicidal. but typically, I went off topic probably about 100 times throughout this entire post and started complaining about my life or telling things no one asked to read about, when I tried to write as neutral as I can and just give you information to get your opinion. so...sorry about that!

"it will be long, I'm sorry","hi, so...there's a situation. before I'll start - english is not my first language, so sorry if my sentences sounds weird or aren't correct grammatically. 

so. for many years now i think that I'm depressed, but there are things that make me feel like I'm imagining things or something, i don't even know. because i feel things that depressed people feel - i have no strength to do basic things, i struggle to even brush my teeth and i need to prepare myself for taking a stupid shower. i just don't have strength and motivation to do anything. i have huge problems with my sleep and i can't eat normally. not because I'm trying to starve myself, i just literally don't have strength for eating and sometimes i even forget about it until I suddenly feel weak. and if i actually want to eat something, i have problems to pick anything because i have no appetite, so at the end i still eat little, but i guess that it doesn't matter since i don't want to actually starve myself and when I'm REALLY hungry then i can force myself to eat even stupid cereals. 

my condition in general is terrible and I'm tired by everything I'm doing, even 8 hours in work is twice harder than it should be. and when I'm finishing something that basic like cleaning the house, then I'm very proud of myself and i feel like i just did a great work. I'm also very often thinking about basic depression things like 'is there a point?' or 'I am useless and pathetic, why I am even here if i am a failure in everything?' and other things like that. I also have a lot of emotional rollercoasters and I can start crying suddenly without any reason at all, and when I have the reason then I can't control my emotions and I'm starting crying even in public and humiliating myself in the process (I'm an adult, so I should control my emotions in public, that's so embarrassing).

I didn't mention a lot of things, but in general - I'm a wreck, yeah. but the point of this post if not to whine and complaining, and I'm sorry if I did it unintentionally, I'm just trying to explain everything the best i can. the point is, that I don't have one huge part of depression - I am not suicidal. actually quite opposite, I have a really big and serious phobia of death, I can have a panic attack even just because I started to think that one day I will die and disappear, that everything will not just go dark and I'll wake up later, but that I will literally disappear and I won't even be able to hear my thoughts or have another life, that I will just stop existing. even while writing these few stupid words I have tears in my eyes and I started breathing heavier. and I also appreciate a lot of things in life, and while I hate a lot of dumb and awful people and how cruel this word is, I see and love a lot of things that good humans made or beautiful things that nature made. and I am literally paranoid about everything that can take my life. and everything can take our life, so my life is a one big paranoia, a lot of small phobias is connected to this one big phobia. I'm afraid of a LOT of things and everything is stressing me, and even making me think about stupid scenarios like ""what if i would just have a car crash?"" or ""what if someone would just want to kidnap me or hurt me?""

I'm trying to function in a society since I have to, but I'm stressed about everything, even basic things like driving a car or walking alone by the street (I'm a woman so i actually have reasons to be afraid of walking alone, so it doesn't help my paranoia). of course, I'm doing all of this, I'm not sitting all days locked in my room just because life stressing me out and is exhausting. I'm trying to live, I'm trying really hard and I'm constantly crossing my comfort zone, almost everyday. even if everything is a huge effort for me, like every single thing, I'm still fighting everyday to just live and not ruin my life more than it's ruined already. 

and I'm really confused is what I have is depression or if I'm just pathetic or something, I don't know how to even describe that, i don't know how to think about myself. I had a therapy once, I was...surprise, who would have thought...scared, to go to a therapy since it could take my money without a reason (if that wouldn't help) and on top of that, my father was mocking me about even needing therapy. but I tried, so I had a therapy for a whole year. and yes, it didn't help. I think that maybe I found a not really good therapist, but I tried to trust her since she was all the time really nice and seemed like she wanted to help. but when I talked to her about my depression, she said that I can't have depression since I told her before about many things I appreciate in life, that I'm determined to live and that I'm full of excitement about my passions, and that she don't see it in me. I thought that - well, okay, she's a specialist in her job, I am not, so maybe i am just utterly pathetic and that there's no help for me. I literally don't know what's wrong with me. 

I recently started to think that I also probably have adhd on top of all that, since from what I read in the internet (not just few articles, i read a lot about that, mostly about real experiences from people that actually have diagnosed adhd) everything seems to suits me, and everything i read abouts experiences of people with adhd i think ""oh, yeah, that's me!"" and ""oh, that explains a lot, yeah, that's also me!"". unfortunately when i was during therapy i didn't suspended adhd yet i didn't tried to be diagnosed with it. yet. i was more focused on what's wrong with me and i wanted to have anything that would make me feel like i know what's going on. but eh, all months of therapy was almost useless. like yeah, it was nice to talk about my problems with someone who can tell me more than ""I'm sorry to hear that"", but it didn't actually helped me in anything. and i didn't even received any diagnoses, which was the main thing i wanted when i came there. i resigned after a year and now i don't have any therapy even if I'm aware that I should. i don't have great work and I'm not rich, i prefer to spend every salary on more important things like food, tickets on train since i don't have my job in the same city i live in, and all other basic needs or things that makes me happy and I'm passionate about, since it helps me to have at least a bit of joy when i feel like sh*t (idk if i can swear here so I'll censor). i just can't afford a therapy, and yeah, i know, maybe if i would try harder, started putting aside part of my salary, stopped buying some less important things like these about my passions...then probably I could afford a therapy. but. I'm reluctant to even try, since it didn't work last time, and happened exactly what i was scared about - i spend my money without a reason, I didn't felt like anything changed and even after a year I felt like everything is the same and that wasting my money on that was pointless.

and honestly i don't think that it will have sense even in the future. like, I know that I'm struggling and my life is sh*t, that I'm a failure and all that, but there's no point. I don't think that my phobia of death will be healed, even if I would try. that's something that just won't go away and it will be with me until my last moment, because that's something that I won't escape. there's a lot of phobias, like darkness or bugs, and healing them is possible, because that's something we can work on. but death? how I can work on that? I can't. that's something that will happen and this paranoia about that will be with me always. I know that the only one thing I can do about that is accept it, and embrace something that is just as natural as being born. but the point of this phobia is that I literally can't. maybe in the future? I still hope that my life will be better someday, and I hope that if it will happen, then my phobia will be less destructive. since maybe I finally will be happy one day, and in that case, maybe my phobia even if still being there, will be just a part of me that will make me helpless and scared sometimes, but not causing panic attacks. but for now, it's strong and a bit ruining my life. I mean, there's a lot of things that's ruining my life. but I just have the impression that this one phobia is a main thing and every other phobias are just a result of this one phobia. 

and besides any phobias, if I have adhd and depression, that's another things that's making my life a lot harder than it's already and if i really have adhd then that's also a thing that was making my life harder since i was a kid. because yes, I was struggling even as a little dumb kid, always being hyperactive, having problems with concentration, and struggling for every one year of my whole education since I always had a lot of problems with learning and I needed to try harder than other kids to understand basic things in school. and I always needed more creative and stimulating ways to understand things better and to be actually interested in them. and I won't even talk about how terrible is my memory and how much I was upset at myself that I just can't remember things and that I need to spend so much time on learning stuff, and that even if I actually knew something, it often just disappeared from my mind in the moment I looked at the test. just great that no one suspended that maybe I have adhd and that no one decided to make my life easier and check if maybe I'm not just stupid. because like...I think a lot of awful things about myself, and maybe NOW I am stupid, but I clearly remember that as a kid I was reading a lot of books and when I was actually passionate about some subjects and when I was learning things in a more creative and stimulating ways, then I was able to learn a lot of interesting things and actually remember them. I remember how passionate I was as a little kid about cosmos, planets, stars and stuff like that. I was reading a lot of science books about that and even my parents was buying me science books about cosmos and stars on my birthdays apart of some dolls. but well, then somehow I went to school and barely passed a math test after learing a whole week for this sh*t. what a stupid kid, hmm, interesting if maybe something is wrong. nah, probably just stupid kid.

ANYWAY.

the point of this post was just to explain my situation and ask you guys if you think that I have depression since I'm not suicidal. but typically, I went off topic probably about 100 times throughout this entire post and started complaining about my life or telling things no one asked to read about, when I tried to write as neutral as I can and just give you information to get your opinion. so...sorry about that!

"it will be long, I'm sorry","hi, so...there's a situation. before I'll start - english is not my first language, so sorry if my sentences sounds weird or aren't correct grammatically. 

so. for many years now i think that I'm depressed, but there are things that make me feel like I'm imagining things or something, i don't even know. because i feel things that depressed people feel - i have no strength to do basic things, i struggle to even brush my teeth and i need to prepare myself for taking a stupid shower. i just don't have strength and motivation to do anything. i have huge problems with my sleep and i can't eat normally. not because I'm trying to starve myself, i just literally don't have strength for eating and sometimes i even forget about it until I suddenly feel weak. and if i actually want to eat something, i have problems to pick anything because i have no appetite, so at the end i still eat little, but i guess that it doesn't matter since i don't want to actually starve myself and when I'm REALLY hungry then i can force myself to eat even stupid cereals. 

my condition in general is terrible and I'm tired by everything I'm doing, even 8 hours in work is twice harder than it should be. and when I'm finishing something that basic like cleaning the house, then I'm very proud of myself and i feel like i just did a great work. I'm also very often thinking about basic depression things like 'is there a point?' or 'I am useless and pathetic, why I am even here if i am a failure in everything?' and other things like that. I also have a lot of emotional rollercoasters and I can start crying suddenly without any reason at all, and when I have the reason then I can't control my emotions and I'm starting crying even in public and humiliating myself in the process (I'm an adult, so I should control my emotions in public, that's so embarrassing).

"Poor, I need handholding for every adult thing and self-image","I’m on disability right now but since my boyfriend is in the picture I have to provide a laundry list of shit to send to the provincial government or else they won’t send me my income, we are so close to eviction already.

My trial runs on italki havent been the best.

I feel like the teachers are actively encouraging me to use something other than italki. Not directly but you can feel it. Idk why

Maybe they’re supposed to recommend other resources?

I just want someone to talk to in these languages and talk ABOUT these languages and learn more and be fluent one day. But I felt like they were trying to get rid of me.

I don’t feel very cute and beautiful anymore. I really wanna feminise myself so that I can pass as a girl. Not all the time but I just want the option.

I’m nervous about consulting a doctor about it because I’m not trans, this is pretty much vanity I guess? I’m also a little scare that taking hormones will kill my libido and I don’t really want plastic surgery. I wanna look natural. 

Maybe it’s not meant to be and I should just accept it. Some friends have suggested going into porn and like… no. My dick doesn’t do anything right. I’m useless.

Taxes? Receipts? No one taught me this shit! Whatever rebates cash back thingies i do need desperately. I don’t wanna get dinged for fucking it up. My boyfriend helps me but, when he’s gone….. I’ll be all alone. Everyone who helped me will be gone. No younger man will help me. I have to act my own age. But I can’t because of my learning disability. There’s no way the social healthcare budget can get me a carer unless I’m in a home. I don’t even know how “rewards points” work at restaurants or stores. It’s absolute gibberish to me.

I don’t have my own car, my friends can’t come to me because they work and live far. I want nothing to do with my family.

I don’t want people doing my adult things _for_ me! But I want to learn how to do it for myself. However there will always be unknowns where I’m like “what is this? What do I do?” and am completely lost.

My boyfriend says he won’t let that happen. I just hate how gung-ho he is whereas I’m in so much agony and fear! I don’t feel safe! I don’t wanna be homeless!

I only have my boyfriend. I don’t have anyone else. I wish I had better parents.

The Circle K burned down. Pizza Amore got rid of their breakfast meals. Wing House doesn’t have desserts or sandwiches. No one is hiring me. I want to move. But we can’t. Not just because of our lease but because money is frighteningly tight.

We can forego useless pleasures, but it’s still not enough.

I’m so jealous of people with pretty rooms and a clean house and time energy and motivation to stay fit. Clothes are expensive. The weather stinks! It should be springtime already!

I’ve gone without eating then I eat till I’m sick. Just to fill the void of ennui.

There’s this guy who is offering 600 $ for a week-end of fun. No I’m serious. I’m gonna take it. Rent. Rent. RENT! Car payments! Fuckin hydro! We still haven’t had warm water in months! I’ve never showered at home since. I don’t remember the last time I did. I don’t smell too bad. Some guys are into that. But it’s just another reminder that I’m suffering from poverty. Something my family never knew for generations. But of course I’m the prodigal son. The black sheep.

My boyfriend lost his job and does part time work now at an auto parts shoppe and does SkipTheDishes whenever he’s off work. Even during the same day. So I never have the car. But it’s not about me. I can’t be selfish. We need this…to live.

I need….. I need a bed buddy. I need a cry buddy. W-wow I didn’t even think about my own boyfriend… we are not exclusive but.. I felt that. I feel the need for someone outside my situation I guess. Psychiatry is weird.",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
My trying doesn't feel like enough,"I've felt inferior to my peers my entire life, never been good at anything at all, shit in school and in personal life.

I've always had depression, probably genetic to some degree as my mom has pretty bad depression as well as sister, and most my cousins + whole family is fucky mentally.

It makes things feel very very hard for me. I want to do things though, I really do. The most consistent thing I've ever done is now, I've studied Japanese everyday for 2 months but, it feels so meaningless. I use Anki everyday (flashcard vocab) but, can rarely ever bring myself to do anything else like practice grammar (did maybe for 2 hours total over the span of the 2 months), I've watched 1 thing so far fully in Japanese and don't feel like doing more since I just feel very apathetic, but I want too, I had so much fun just recognizing words. (tried to learn Spanish before and have the same just joy understanding things, I like languages a lot as an example of a passion that I'm just too apathetic to pursue)  


With that some days I only did 10 minutes, usually 30 minutes but, it still like I said doesn't feel like I do enough. Not even within learning a language, I studied math for 1 hour 1 day, and thought ""finally gonna get my shit together and use my time properly"" and never studied again besides maybe once or twice for 15 minutes each.

There's also just so many other things I muster up the energy to do for 1 or 2 days then I fall off.

The simplest things that are just consuming content as well are hard for me, I wanted to watch 365 movies this year, I did a fuck ton the first month and am at 90 as of today, which sounds good until it's noted that for March I watched I think 5 and February 8, so went really hard into watching 2 or more a day then crashed out for no real reason, wasn't ""burn out"" either, I just couldn't bring myself to do anything and felt like sleeping and it's been like that 2 months now.

I always just have to wait it out but the ""good"" stages of my mental health only last say a month then I have 3 or more of just straight misery where I feel hopeless, and sometimes (most the time) I don't even get a month of ""good"" I get 1 day, or if I'm lucky a week.

Now, what do I do all day if I can't bring myself to do things I actually enjoy like playing video games, watching movies, or reading? Well I don't know. My days just melt together, usually I watch Youtube but, I don't really like it if that makes sense, I don't know why it's ""easier"" for me to watch that then say something like a movie I'd enjoy but it is and it makes me feel bad since I want to do things I actually enjoy.

I just feel very tired most the time and it will never not upset me that out of 16 awake hours (if that) I can maybe do 1 hour of something productive/enjoyable and it will never not upset me that most of the time even an hour is generous and it's more like 10 minutes, if that.",depression,,Anki,24.4690842,75.888834
Been in my room for 3 days,"I don’t talk to anyone at all about how I feel anymore. Tired of the same bullshit and questions. People act like fucking idiots who never have read a goddamn book or put a fucking context clue together.
Anyway I’m fed the fuck up and can’t do anything but scroll on my phone and stay in bed. My meds aren’t doing a fucking thing anymore, I thought they worked. Been taking them for over a year. Thought for the first time in 10 years I found the right pills. 
I’ve done TMS. I’m just heartbroken from my parents never loving me and I can’t move on from it. I see it in everything and everyone. I see it in myself. 
Fucking stuck with nobody to call. Help me please. ",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
I feel miserable,"I am a 30 years old man soon to turn 31 and am supposed to graduate from my second master’s in the end of April. I studied psychology and reorientated myself to biostatistics. I only have one class left but I am probably going to fail it. 

I have diagnosed depression since this summer and ADD. 

I feel like a failure. I live at my parents, can’t find a job in my field or at minimum salary and am failing at school. This morning, I asked for social welfare (which is last resort financial help in Canada). Even if I had relationships in the past, they also all failed and I can’t get into a new one, at least not in my current situation. I feel like I’m doomed to be a loser. My friends are all in relationships, have their own place, are well into their careers and are overall successful. I feel like I’m the loser of my group, or am simply a loser in general and I don’t see how this could change in the future. I feel like I am a dumbass, and that I am hopeless. 

I don’t see how I could get my life back on track as no matter how hard I try, I can’t find a job and I don’t understand the material from my final class. I tried applying for hundreds of jobs, and I tried asking my professor for some advice on how to succeed my class and that doesn’t work. 

I feel stuck in my depression, I can’t seem to find pleasure in anything. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like there is nothing I can do.",depression,,Canada,61.0666922,-107.991707
"I'm 16 and I've always had a terrible life, I wanna kill myself","I'm 16 and I've always hated my life as I never really had anything good happen to me, I've been living just for the sake of it without putting any thought into it for years. I don't really want to live but death is just too scary for someone like me so it's really hard to actually commit suicide.

I've always had a terrible family and no friends pretty much, I never really felt connected to the world around me and I don't really feel like I belong here too much, for some reason I exist and I guess I have to make use of it somehow.

I didn't go to school much as I didn't really see the need for much education and my dad never really liked or went to school himself and days when I did go to school I really didn't want to I just had to. I had mental health issues from a very early age and I was treated badly in both my house and in school so I felt really depressed already early on.

My family have hit me, always scolded me for being who I am. Whether that'd be just me laying down in bed all day, or just playing games and all that. They wanted me to always work and living in this environment I've actually grown up to be a workaholic later on.

I never really had mental or physical care so I feel like I've lived in an environment that just isn't ""normal"" and yeah the life I live certainly isn't ""normal""

I was bullied around in school and was sort of alone, back a few years ago when I was in school (before 2020) I would not talk to anyone and just go to school feeling like shit, when I came back I just wanted to play games and do nothing else, I hated the way things just were. When I used to talk to people I still felt like I didn't really make much sense or connect to them in anyway, I felt that people didn't love me, and maybe it was because they didn't or it was just me.

Ever since 2020 and after I've just been living home not doing anything other than gaming, masturbating, watching YouTube and listening to music and whatnot. I just go for cheap entertainment because it calms me down and gets the time spending fast.

I still have hope for my future, back in 2023 I met a girl and we've been friends for some time, I can't stop thinking about her and I think I want to spend my entire life with her, it would help me escape from my bad childhood and she also hasn't had a good childhood either so it's kind of a relief to have someone that understands what you go through. Even if she ain't going to be in a perfect mental state it's better than the sons of bitches I live with right now.

I need to move to England and in order to do this I need a 5 year visa (as far as I understand not 100% sure) and stay in England for 5 years then I can get a indefinite visa which allows me to stay for a life-time.

During those 5 years I want to be with my friend and live together, I want to spend my life with her and move on from the pain that has been my life up to this point.

I would like someone to tell me how good of a plan this is as I need someone else to tell me it's good because I don't have enough self-confidence to know if this is good.

Please reply if you've read this post this far. I wanted to share my feelings because I feel better when I do but I hope you have something to say that might make me feel better.",depression,,England,52.5310214,-1.2649062

Im scared of dying,"This is my first time making a post here , i hope i dont look stupid, i dont even know if im allowed to post just to vent, but i have no other one so ill do it here. I just feel so lonely. Im only 17 years old. My parents good divorced almost 8 years ago and ive been abused by my stepmom for as long as she came into our life. I lived a life of constant , anxiety , sadness, loneliness and helplessness. And since my mother went in italy to live there five years ago it didnt make things easier for me. Even now that i live with my grandma there are times where i argue with her and she just tells me to go back to my home. And i dont want to play the role of the victim because i act like an asshole as well. I just wish i didnt feel like unwanted trash, i wish i could be happy. I have thought of killing myself multiple times as well, i even tried drinking soap once when i was younger because i thought it would work. And now as im older i still have to. I dont see myself having a life in here, even now im planning to kill myself with paracetamols but its so scary. But then even if its painful for two days it will finally be over. And if theres an afterlife maybe ill be happy somewhere out there.Just not here.

"I always try so damn hard my whole life to be better, and it’s never enough. I’m gonna finally die.","(Context: I was a foreign student) Okay well basically I (19M) was getting panic attacks everyday in the UK from September to December, due to a bunch of trauma related to education when I got severe depression in the past. The Uni I was in had a lot of not so great people either. Anyway, at the tail end of December I attempted to take my life with scissors slicing my throat open but then the nurse caught me and I was under watch for the rest of the night at the uni. I was put under the National health care service (NHS) where their crisis team would check me everyday to make I hadn’t died or killed myself. They gave me two different medications which made me even worse. It messed up my brain chemistry. 

Everything from here happened in January.
Then in the beginning of January I was hurting myself by cutting my arms and legs with scissors and keys. Whereby then I went absolutely insane during one of their visits and they thought I was really gonna die so they forcefully admitted me into a psychiatric ward in the town over. If I didn’t come willingly they would’ve forced me in there and sectioned me. So when I was there I was around many different people. Constantly hearing screams at night and completely delusional people as well. I was completely manic some days. I met this girl there. Her name was Wendy (19F). After staying the ward a couple days, we both realised we loved each other and got into a relationship. She was my first girlfriend. She had BPD. From that day we hung out all the time. Due to her BPD she can switch to someone horrible when she drinks too much. So when we went on a bender with another friend I made there by sneaking out of the hospital, I got incredibly drunk as we walked around town blasting music and drinking. So when we got back I couldn’t move because I was so drunk I may puke. But because she drank too much she switched and started calling me horrible names and everything. I cried. The next day she explained to me how the BPD works and that she’s sorry. I know how sweet and amazing she is in reality, plus I loved her. So I forgave her. Fast forward a couple of days she has to leave the ward because she’s been in too long and she deicdes to stays with her friend. Long story short, she stole money from me and tried to steal money from her the next morning. Kicking her out immediately that same morning. Wendy was depressed and hurt and I spent nearly 8 hours meeting up with her and finding her a place to live somewhere in town because she’s basically homeless. Lost 200 GBP in a stupid mistake in trying to get her lodging. I managed to get another friend I met in the ward to give her a place to stay. Then I went back to the ward myself. I was then told the next day that I was being discharged even though I wasn’t ready and I was terrified. None of the other patients want me to leave as they know I’m not ready but I just got an asshole doctor which discharged me. So a couple days pass and I’m sent back to my uni lodgings at night. The moment I enter my room I have a panic attack and hurt myself. I find out they forgot to give me my medicine too. I rush back that same night despite exhaustion and when ur each the hospital I break down in front of the ward. Crying and nearly vomiting on staff because I wanted to go back in. I was on the floor puking in the bathroom screaming and saying I was gonna kill myself. They said they couldn’t take me so they tried taking me to action and emergency. But then I was so scared. So they drugged me up heavily with Promethazine (Muscle relaxant) so that I wouldn’t be able to think or move or speak. And sent me back to the uni. So a couple days go by and I’m practically bed ridden in my room unable to speak without slurring due to the amount I’m given. The next day I’m made to be in a meeting with the head academic supervisor of the university and my school counsellor. They tell me that I either voluntarily leave the uni through withdrawing my visa or they force me out by eliminating my visa forcefully. By this point I was insane. So then I had to mediate between my dad and mum as I had to pretend I loved my dad more and want his support because he can afford to bring me back. So in essence I decided to withdraw my visa voluntarily. And my dad would come pick me up in a week. Then Wendy wanted to stay at my place for a day as she was free. So she came over and she slept over in my room. The next day I had to organise a meeting with the uni people including higher ups to prep them with what to say to my dad that would not legally get them in trouble or screw me over when he asks questions as if he’s mad my life may have been over. But while this is happening, Wendy was crying on the phone because her mother was being horrible and forced her away from me and she was breaking down on street in town while on the phone with me on the way to my meeting. After all that I went back to my room where before she was forced away she had cleaned my room. I broke down in tears crying. I still couldn’t rest, shortly after the crisis team came to check on me and I was completely manic and insane speaking to them. A couple days pass and Wendy is able to stay over now until my dad picks me up. She missed me and wanted to stay with me until then. So she comes over and we just hangout together and love each other. I made sure the laundry was done and the room tidy. That the bedsheets were clean and warm and that the coffee she loved I had. I set up movies, cuddle spaces, I gave her the best side of her bed and paid for her food. We had sex and I helped her open up more, and comfort her when her mother is being a horrible person. I help teach her to feel her feeling better. But then two nights before I leave, we decided to drink a little. I was against it but she promised she wouldn’t drink a lot so okay. I accidentally drink too much and I’m feeling sick. Wendy in the midst of finally feeling her own feelings for the first time in a while thinks she hurt me and tries kill herself in my bathroom while cutting up her body with a razor. So when she exited she had overdosed and was bleeding all over. Leaving my bathroom all red too. Im still heavily drunk so I keep feeling like puling but I try my best to remind her it’s all okay. She collapses and I think she died. I desperately get my neighbour to call the ambulance. I get them on the phone and Wendy wakes up to stop me from getting the ambulance to come saying she’s okay. I black out in my bed thinking she’s dying. I wake up and afraid she might be dying as we talk and all but I try to stay calm. So we talk and sort things out and she says she won’t do it again. We have a big dinner as it is our last night and I take her stargazing. The next day comes and I have to see my abusive dad. That happens. Instead of taking me to Malaysia he decides to use this opportunity to holiday. We reach the hotel and I’m shaking, panicking, crying, and shivering on the floor because of everything that has happened and is happening. He ignores me. A few days go bye and I keep in regular contact with Wendy and a friend Mark. Wendy is staying with Mark temporarily after she stayed with me. So those days pass while I’m jsut unable to do much without wanting to kill or hurt myself. Then I get horrible messages sent to me from Wendy. Completely insulting me and berating me. Calling me nasty things. I find out she tried kill herself again via overdose and my friend Mark drove her to action and emergency. She was spouting horrible things about him too so the hospital kicked him out. Then the last thing she told me was that she was dying and that I’m a horrible person. Her BPD activated because she was jsut beginning to feel her feelings and accept who she is, but also letting me in and not having her meds since she tried to overdose on them in my bathroom. Next thing I know she ran away from the hospital, threw her phone away in a random park and went missing. My dad continues to mess me up while I’m in the hotel. The whole thing with Wendy messed Mark up and he tied to kill himself multiple times while I tried to stop him over the phone. Then my dad took me on the plane back to Malaysia while being incredibly mad at me for panicking. I reached home and without medicine I was combatant trying to kill myself. I gave myself a concussion and tried to scratch my arms. My little brother threw away my self harm fork. I wa made to see a therapist which tried to put me in another ward which was the picture. I managed to avoid it somehow Then through a lot of begging behind the scenes I was allowed to see a psychiatrist. 

This is February.
My dad wanted to send me but he was getting mad while we were waiting in the hospital. He burst into my appointment and scolded my doctor then left. After my appointment, he was screaming how horrible my mum is in front of the hospital. The next couple days he tried to get me to cut all ties with my mum because he thinks she had an affair while they were married and is brainwashing us. He still hasn’t gotten over her. He tried to take legal action against me to leave his house because I might kill myself. Everyday it’s like I’m thirsty in a desert and there’s a huge bottle of water right in front of me. That water is to die. It’s like an itch to kill myself and I really want to scratch it every second. The new medication from the doctor has made me more sane now that I can speak and type. Without it I’d be unrecognisable. Completely insane, crazy, swearing, slurring, louder and just nuts. So after that I was given an ultimatum to either stay with my abusive father or live with my mum. The answer sounds easy but I couldn’t choose to stay with my mum. If I leave my dad, I’d lose out on inheritance I have been fighting for for 19 years, lose my ability to go overseas to study, my you’d be brother could lose stability, I’d force my mum back from her new life in Australia, strain her relationship there with her boyfriend and take money away from my brothers’ future funds from my mum  to afford my education costs. I felt too guilty and couldn’t do it even if I may kill myself. My your younger brother and mum want me to stay with her but I just can’t. I’d would take away so much from everyone. Despite having done so much for all of them. So I sucked up to my dad and managed to avoid having to cut all ties with my mum. I still want to kill my self everyday. It is so hard not to do it. It drives me mad. I’m now visiting my mum and not killing is so hard. 

Obviously there’s a lot more detail but this is what has happened. I’ll probably die soon.

Even before this my dad put me through so much Abuse. Physical, emotional, financial. He’s nearly killed me. I’m just so unlovable, I’m so fucking unlovable. I’m ugly, stupid, worthless and disgusting. Fuck me. Fuck this. I’m fucking tired. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. Nobody will ever love me. I know it’s wrong to peg your self perception on another person and I was working on that for years and it was getting better. But what if you life’s whole goal in the back of your mind was to find proof that you were capable of being loved and you finally got it? That’s how I felt. That my life was completed. That I was done with that part. But no. Of course not. Fuck me always fuck me. The meds are barely keeping me sane enough to eat talk, type and walk. I want to stop it, so no more concussion I give myself but truly death. Pure and fucking simple. I want to do it so badly. Of course if I truly wanted to die I’d just do it. That’s why I need to be off the meds to full do it. So I can finally be at peace.

I feel really really bad. I’m gonna throw my meds out and stop this fucking shit. I fucking hate living. I know I’ve gotten bitter and I never wanted to get bitter, but fuck everyone else who just has it so swell. I know so many of them so personally and I know they haven’t had to try even an increment of what I have in an attempt to feel happy. I’m so bitter now. I used to be so afraid of becoming bitter. FUCK THEM. FUCK THEM FOR HAVING IT SO FUCKING EASY FUCK THEM FOR BEING HAPPY I FUCKING I HATE MYSELF FUCK FUCK FUCK I JUST WANT TO BE FUCKING HAPPY PLEASE IS THAT SO BAD. But no. I’m not allowed to live stably and normally in a sense. Of course I’m not. I’m writing this at 2am, it’s getting closer it’s finally coming. All that’s left is throwing away the medicine. Fucking finally.

But while this is happening, Wendy was crying on the phone because her mother was being horrible and forced her away from me and she was breaking down on street in town while on the phone with me on the way to my meeting. After all that I went back to my room where before she was forced away she had cleaned my room. I broke down in tears crying. I still couldn’t rest, shortly after the crisis team came to check on me and I was completely manic and insane speaking to them. A couple days pass and Wendy is able to stay over now until my dad picks me up. She missed me and wanted to stay with me until then. So she comes over and we just hangout together and love each other. I made sure the laundry was done and the room tidy. That the bedsheets were clean and warm and that the coffee she loved I had. I set up movies, cuddle spaces, I gave her the best side of her bed and paid for her food. We had sex and I helped her open up more, and comfort her when her mother is being a horrible person. I help teach her to feel her feeling better. But then two nights before I leave, we decided to drink a little. I was against it but she promised she wouldn’t drink a lot so okay. I accidentally drink too much and I’m feeling sick. Wendy in the midst of finally feeling her own feelings for the first time in a while thinks she hurt me and tries kill herself in my bathroom while cutting up her body with a razor. So when she exited she had overdosed and was bleeding all over. Leaving my bathroom all red too. Im still heavily drunk so I keep feeling like puling but I try my best to remind her it’s all okay. She collapses and I think she died. I desperately get my neighbour to call the ambulance. I get them on the phone and Wendy wakes up to stop me from getting the ambulance to come saying she’s okay. I black out in my bed thinking she’s dying. I wake up and afraid she might be dying as we talk and all but I try to stay calm. So we talk and sort things out and she says she won’t do it again. We have a big dinner as it is our last night and I take her stargazing. The next day comes and I have to see my abusive dad. That happens. Instead of taking me to Malaysia he decides to use this opportunity to holiday. We reach the hotel and I’m shaking, panicking, crying, and shivering on the floor because of everything that has happened and is happening. He ignores me. A few days go bye and I keep in regular contact with Wendy and a friend Mark. Wendy is staying with Mark temporarily after she stayed with me. So those days pass while I’m jsut unable to do much without wanting to kill or hurt myself. Then I get horrible messages sent to me from Wendy. Completely insulting me and berating me. Calling me nasty things. I find out she tried kill herself again via overdose and my friend Mark drove her to action and emergency. She was spouting horrible things about him too so the hospital kicked him out. Then the last thing she told me was that she was dying and that I’m a horrible person. Her BPD activated because she was jsut beginning to feel her feelings and accept who she is, but also letting me in and not having her meds since she tried to overdose on them in my bathroom. Next thing I know she ran away from the hospital, threw her phone away in a random park and went missing. My dad continues to mess me up while I’m in the hotel. The whole thing with Wendy messed Mark up and he tied to kill himself multiple times while I tried to stop him over the phone. Then my dad took me on the plane back to Malaysia while being incredibly mad at me for panicking. I reached home and without medicine I was combatant trying to kill myself. I gave myself a concussion and tried to scratch my arms. My little brother threw away my self harm fork. I wa made to see a therapist which tried to put me in another ward which was the picture. I managed to avoid it somehow Then through a lot of begging behind the scenes I was allowed to see a psychiatrist. 

This is February.
My dad wanted to send me but he was getting mad while we were waiting in the hospital. He burst into my appointment and scolded my doctor then left. After my appointment, he was screaming how horrible my mum is in front of the hospital. The next couple days he tried to get me to cut all ties with my mum because he thinks she had an affair while they were married and is brainwashing us. He still hasn’t gotten over her. He tried to take legal action against me to leave his house because I might kill myself. Everyday it’s like I’m thirsty in a desert and there’s a huge bottle of water right in front of me. That water is to die. It’s like an itch to kill myself and I really want to scratch it every second. The new medication from the doctor has made me more sane now that I can speak and type. Without it I’d be unrecognisable. Completely insane, crazy, swearing, slurring, louder and just nuts. So after that I was given an ultimatum to either stay with my abusive father or live with my mum. The answer sounds easy but I couldn’t choose to stay with my mum. If I leave my dad, I’d lose out on inheritance I have been fighting for for 19 years, lose my ability to go overseas to study, my you’d be brother could lose stability, I’d force my mum back from her new life in Australia, strain her relationship there with her boyfriend and take money away from my brothers’ future funds from my mum  to afford my education costs. I felt too guilty and couldn’t do it even if I may kill myself. My your younger brother and mum want me to stay with her but I just can’t. I’d would take away so much from everyone. Despite having done so much for all of them. So I sucked up to my dad and managed to avoid having to cut all ties with my mum. I still want to kill my self everyday. It is so hard not to do it. It drives me mad. I’m now visiting my mum and not killing is so hard. 

Obviously there’s a lot more detail but this is what has happened. I’ll probably die soon.

Even before this my dad put me through so much Abuse. Physical, emotional, financial. He’s nearly killed me. I’m just so unlovable, I’m so fucking unlovable. I’m ugly, stupid, worthless and disgusting. Fuck me. Fuck this. I’m fucking tired. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. Nobody will ever love me. I know it’s wrong to peg your self perception on another person and I was working on that for years and it was getting better. But what if you life’s whole goal in the back of your mind was to find proof that you were capable of being loved and you finally got it? That’s how I felt. That my life was completed. That I was done with that part. But no. Of course not. Fuck me always fuck me. The meds are barely keeping me sane enough to eat talk, type and walk. I want to stop it, so no more concussion I give myself but truly death. Pure and fucking simple. I want to do it so badly. Of course if I truly wanted to die I’d just do it. That’s why I need to be off the meds to full do it. So I can finally be at peace.

I feel really really bad. I’m gonna throw my meds out and stop this fucking shit. I fucking hate living. I know I’ve gotten bitter and I never wanted to get bitter, but fuck everyone else who just has it so swell. I know so many of them so personally and I know they haven’t had to try even an increment of what I have in an attempt to feel happy. I’m so bitter now. I used to be so afraid of becoming bitter. FUCK THEM. FUCK THEM FOR HAVING IT SO FUCKING EASY FUCK THEM FOR BEING HAPPY I FUCKING I HATE MYSELF FUCK FUCK FUCK I JUST WANT TO BE FUCKING HAPPY PLEASE IS THAT SO BAD. But no. I’m not allowed to live stably and normally in a sense. Of course I’m not. I’m writing this at 2am, it’s getting closer it’s finally coming. All that’s left is throwing away the medicine.

"I always try so damn hard my whole life to be better, and it’s never enough. I’m gonna finally die.","(Context: I was a foreign student) Okay well basically I (19M) was getting panic attacks everyday in the UK from September to December, due to a bunch of trauma related to education when I got severe depression in the past. The Uni I was in had a lot of not so great people either. Anyway, at the tail end of December I attempted to take my life with scissors slicing my throat open but then the nurse caught me and I was under watch for the rest of the night at the uni. I was put under the National health care service (NHS) where their crisis team would check me everyday to make I hadn’t died or killed myself. They gave me two different medications which made me even worse. It messed up my brain chemistry. 

Everything from here happened in January.
Then in the beginning of January I was hurting myself by cutting my arms and legs with scissors and keys. Whereby then I went absolutely insane during one of their visits and they thought I was really gonna die so they forcefully admitted me into a psychiatric ward in the town over. If I didn’t come willingly they would’ve forced me in there and sectioned me. So when I was there I was around many different people. Constantly hearing screams at night and completely delusional people as well. I was completely manic some days. I met this girl there. Her name was Wendy (19F). After staying the ward a couple days, we both realised we loved each other and got into a relationship. She was my first girlfriend. She had BPD. From that day we hung out all the time. Due to her BPD she can switch to someone horrible when she drinks too much. So when we went on a bender with another friend I made there by sneaking out of the hospital, I got incredibly drunk as we walked around town blasting music and drinking. So when we got back I couldn’t move because I was so drunk I may puke. But because she drank too much she switched and started calling me horrible names and everything. I cried. The next day she explained to me how the BPD works and that she’s sorry. I know how sweet and amazing she is in reality, plus I loved her. So I forgave her. Fast forward a couple of days she has to leave the ward because she’s been in too long and she deicdes to stays with her friend. Long story short, she stole money from me and tried to steal money from her the next morning. Kicking her out immediately that same morning. Wendy was depressed and hurt and I spent nearly 8 hours meeting up with her and finding her a place to live somewhere in town because she’s basically homeless. Lost 200 GBP in a stupid mistake in trying to get her lodging. I managed to get another friend I met in the ward to give her a place to stay. Then I went back to the ward myself. I was then told the next day that I was being discharged even though I wasn’t ready and I was terrified. None of the other patients want me to leave as they know I’m not ready but I just got an asshole doctor which discharged me. So a couple days pass and I’m sent back to my uni lodgings at night. The moment I enter my room I have a panic attack and hurt myself. I find out they forgot to give me my medicine too. I rush back that same night despite exhaustion and when ur each the hospital I break down in front of the ward. Crying and nearly vomiting on staff because I wanted to go back in. I was on the floor puking in the bathroom screaming and saying I was gonna kill myself. They said they couldn’t take me so they tried taking me to action and emergency. But then I was so scared. So they drugged me up heavily with Promethazine (Muscle relaxant) so that I wouldn’t be able to think or move or speak. And sent me back to the uni. So a couple days go by and I’m practically bed ridden in my room unable to speak without slurring due to the amount I’m given. The next day I’m made to be in a meeting with the head academic supervisor of the university and my school counsellor. They tell me that I either voluntarily leave the uni through withdrawing my visa or they force me out by eliminating my visa forcefully. By this point I was insane. So then I had to mediate between my dad and mum as I had to pretend I loved my dad more and want his support because he can afford to bring me back. So in essence I decided to withdraw my visa voluntarily. And my dad would come pick me up in a week. Then Wendy wanted to stay at my place for a day as she was free. So she came over and she slept over in my room. The next day I had to organise a meeting with the uni people including higher ups to prep them with what to say to my dad that would not legally get them in trouble or screw me over when he asks questions as if he’s mad my life may have been over.

I went to the doctor this morning because I needed help. I told her that I don’t feel helped enough, that every psychologist I’ve seen so far hasn’t really made a difference, and that I’m currently dealing with anxiety attacks and terrible sleep. My current psychologist appointments are **two months apart**—that’s how *""not bad""* I apparently am.

I was hoping for something—anything—that would provide some short-term relief. Instead, she just increased my Effexor dosage, which will take weeks to have any effect. Her advice? *If it gets worse, come back.*

That’s it. No validation, no real discussion. Just *wait and see.*

I know my issues aren’t as extreme as others, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t real. It feels like nobody actually cares, and that just reinforces this horrible feeling that my struggles don’t matter. I want answers. I want to understand *why* I am like this. I don’t want to feel so alone in it all.

I don’t even know who to share this with. My friends and family are all struggling with their own issues, and I don’t want to add to their burdens. So I just sit with it, stuck in this loop of feeling unheard and unseen.

Has anyone else been through this? How do you deal with feeling like your problems aren’t *""bad enough""* to matter?",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
involuntarily commited last week,"I was recently involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital after i told someone i was riding around with a gun ready to kill myself because I'm so tired of being depressed and lonely. I recently left my job and had another lined up, but it fell through, and now I've been jobless since the beginning of February. I went from buying and doing everything my 4-year-old son wanted to explaining to him i can't buy batteries for his toys because daddy is broke. my girlfriend is sympathetic, but i can tell she's getting tired of me and my poor mental health. She goes out a lot now, and i feel like it's to avoid having to look at me, and i can't blame her honestly. I've been bipolar type 2 since i was 17, and at 36, i feel miserable knowing i have to deal with this for the rest of my life. has anyone else been able to figure something out because i can't take it anymore. I'm writing this after doing 2 cups of amsterdam and juice, and my girlfriend looked so sad. I'm not even a drinker, but it feels good to not feel like how i do for an hour or 2. I need some help .......",depression,,amsterdam,52.3730796,4.8924534
I Need Help,"I need help.  Six months ago, my partner of three years broke up with me.  He kicked me out of his house that he promised me was my own home as well.  He was abusive in every way there is: emotionally, mentally, verbally, and physically.  For whatever reason, I loved him and cannot seem to get over this break up.  
I am unemployed due to an injury, but do not qualify for unemployment benefits, or social security benefits.  Even if I did, it would not be enough to live off of.  I have been diagnosed with complex PTSD, persistent depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety, ADHD.  I've been able to pull myself up out of the hole of depression multiple times in the past, but this time is very different.  
I cannot seem to find hope, motivation, ambition, or the desire for anything.  I don't care to see anyone, hear anyone, do anything, hang out with anyone anywhere, get a job, find a place to live, and if I didn't have to get out of bed, I wouldn't.  I am forty years old and had to move back in with my parents when my ex kicked me out of his house.  I avoid my parents at all cost because I'll probably just disappoint them, and they'll absolutely get onto me about what I ""should"" do.  
Granted, I should probably listen to them and just do whatever they say, as it's better for me than whatever the hell I do on my own now.  


Nothing in the town where I live is affordable.  I mean nothing.  I have no college degree, no special skills that are worth mentioning, and to sum it up pretty accurately, I'm a loser, just as my ex told me I am.  
I've got nothing.  If I keep going on like this, I'm just going to die.  Heartbreak, depression, carelessness, I don't know what from, but I can feel it.  I'm in no way saying that I am going to harm myself intentionally at all.  I just feel sick.  Not as in virus sick, but like, just sick.  Almost like how I hear what it's like to experience failure to thrive.

I have no clue what I need to do, but I'm wondering if any of you have some experience to share... Thank you if so.  Even if you don't, just thanks for reading and for being here.",depression,,Heartbreak,50.5110565312352,-120.46418522421844
Stuck in a limbo of wanting to die but can’t end it,"Since I turned 15 I’ve been stuck in this state of wanting to just die but I can’t- my mom doesn’t really care she’s more just understandably frustrated with me.

I’m lost I can’t even watch tv or movies anymore or scroll on social media wishing I could have any other life but mine. At first thinking well others have it worse than me used to help but now :/ I straight up smoke, daydream and cry lmao",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908

Everyone has problems, smaller or bigger, but everyone has em. The thing is, I have no words to describe how i feel right now. I know im powerful inside, but man, im losing hope. I want yall to atleast make me a true favor, mention something in life, and i will tell you why i dont have it, dont matter, or its bad. Idek what im saying, for real, i just want love, im losing my mind. I ONLY KNEW HAPPINESS ONCE IN MY LIFE, and I lost her. I wished to die someday before her. She was the only light i saw in my entire life. Everything was fine with her, i didnt want to be perfect or strive for perfection anymore with her, she was perfect, im shaking only for typing this. But now shes gone. She erased everything bad from my life, i saw light in it for once. But now, Im losing hope. Everyday i wake up and solemnly remember those who lost their lives by depression and try to pay respect to them and try to strive, but im losing hope.

"A trace of joy - written in the middle of something dark, but not without hope","
I wrote this some time ago, during a period when depression had consumed every part of me.
I tried to capture the feeling of hope, that maybe next time will be the last time.
That if I really try, really fight, maybe I won’t end up down here again.
I hope someone out there reads this and recognizes themselves, and feels, even for a moment - I am not alone. 

-
You appear quietly, almost disarming me.
You wait in silence,
reappearing when I dare to forget you.
But I'm not afraid of you.
Monotonous,
alone,
and tired, 
but not afraid.

I used to be afraid,
deeply…
When you emerged only in dark times,
cloaked in silence.
But I was younger then,
seeing danger through a child’s eyes.
It’s still the same shadows, 
just a different light.

You still come to me with the dark,
speaking to my weaker sides,
trying to pull me beneath the surface.
But the truth is- 
I need you.
I’ve never been above the surface.
I exist in the grey,
always fading lower.

I slip into the dark,
slowly...
into the hollow that never ends...
into absolute loneliness.
into a void so real, 
I could describe its shape.

That’s when you come.
My worst nightmares.

You cling to me,
adding weight to the descent I was already in.
And when the dark has claimed every inch of me,
I feel it.. 
the bottom.

The bottom where I find
a rare sense of steadiness.
Where I feel stillness,
in a sea of chaos.

I stand there quietly,
picking through the ruins of what I once felt.
Comparing memories,
searching for glimpses of joy and love, 
echoes of love I saw in others,
but never held myself… 

The quiet joy on a child’s face
when he sees his mother in the doorway. 
no thoughts,
no why,
only the feeling of love.

The couple celebrating forty years of marriage.
Changed by time,
shaped by life...
but in their eyes,
nothing has ever changed.

A family pouring love into a man, 
their son,
their brother, 
when I can no longer love myself.

I focus, 
I need to find it! 
I push off with determination,
leaving you behind, 
the overthinking,
the confusion.

Crawling through the layers
of emptiness and self-hate.
Kicking blindly in panic,
almost breaking through the sorrow,
the fear. 
until I see it… 

That flicker.
That polarizing shimmer, 
so close… 

So close I can almost feel
the sun warming my skin.
So close I can make out
a child's laughter through the noise.
So close I almost begin to remember
what love might feel like.

But I begin to sink again,
quietly.
Barely aware of it.
But this time,
I sink- 
with a trace of joy.

What I’ve seen
is enough to give me hope. 
hope that next time,
I’ll make it all the way.

So I wait.
Listening for your whispers.

My worst nightmares.
My dearest friends.

Travelling and new experiences an antidote to depression,"Long ago, when I was trapped in resistant depression, I decided to embark on a journey of self-discovery. I traveled to Nepal, India, and finally, to the Amazon.

During the early part of my journey, I stayed in ashrams and met sages of the East, experiences that helped me confront my shadows and gain clarity on what no longer served me. I encountered many people, some on a similar mission—searching for answers to personal and existential questions.

By the time I arrived in the Amazon, I began to go deeper, reconnecting with Source and nature. It was here that I believe my depression was integrated, and I found answers to essential questions: What do I want in my life? Who am I?

As my knowledge expanded, I became more accepting of the journey. It's been three years, and I am deeply grateful for the retreats and communities I've engaged with. They provided valuable insights, especially in the area of vulnerability. Gradually, I moved away from the mind and closer to the heart. I still have sad days and anxious days, but now I live through them, knowing they will pass.

This was my journey of saying goodbye to depression and embracing a new purpose and a new life.

Do you think you could benefit from spiritual encounters or connecting with people on the path of truth? If yes, are you willing to travel? Have you ever thought about it?

Reflect on this and share your thoughts. Sometimes, leaving things behind and walking a new path is exactly what we need to return to ourselves.",depression,,Nepal,28.3780464,83.9999901

I’m to that point.,Never thought to post this on Reddit but as a marine who’s been in Afghanistan and has seen it all. I think I’ve just have to be done with life at the moment. I’m tired of the meetings that don’t work the medication that doesn’t work. I’m tired of closing my eyes and seeing nothing and waking up and seeing nothing. Hardest thing I’ve had to do was try to re adjust even after years. I’ve had multiple guns to my head and have never been able to pull the trigger. I don’t know how in 2 years my life can come crashing down and would be suffering from mental health and suicide. I see how people live and I’m here taking one day at a time thinking today is the day that says the date next to my casket. Never really had a father figure and the one father figure I had was my grandpa and he passed away due to Parkinson’s. All I know is where I’m at peace in life id always by the water. Not necessarily the ocean but just water. It calms me naturally. Eating has been harder and harder each day and when I do eat it’s like I don’t have apetite. Used to be solid muscle and went straight to the gym 7 days a week. My motivation has died with me years ago when I got boots back to the states. Worst thing i probably did was get out the corps. I’m 30 years old and when I got out financially I was set and had things going at least. Invested a 1/4 of a million into an investment I had thought with a friend and his dad ended up stealing that money and my friends money who now has leukemia and is now dying. Got into a car accident and came out with 6 surgeries. If someone did black magic on me I would believe it at this point. It’s gotten to where crying myself to sleep like an infant is the norm and thinking of ways to end it are things that I do. Because of this my significant other got an abortion because raising a baby in these times wouldn’t be good. Needless to say we broke up. The worst part is waking up because when I’m asleep I face my demons and stand up to them with my grandfather and my brothers that I lost by my side just like the protector I was born to be. Loyal as a dog my gunny would always say. Would take a bullet for the people I love. I’m just sorry to everyone I can’t love myself the same as I love everyone else ,depression,,Afghanistan,33.7680065,66.2385139
I hate myself,"This is long so bare with me, I'm a 20 year old male, I have anxiety, depression, and I guess I'm suicidal, well to the point where I just don't want to live anymore.

I hate myself, I hate they way that I look, I hate the way that I speak. I’m a pathetic loser who hates working, who is still terribly shy! And never had a girlfriend.

High school for me was a joke, I was average, I hungout with the weirdos because they liked the same stuff as me, I never struggled in school, besides the fact that I hated going, and attendance took a hit, I remember going to the deans office for it, and him going over how attendance is important so that you can keep up with you classes and yadda yadda, then he pulled up my grades and noticed it was all As and Bs even after the fact I missed nearly 2 weeks of school and he basically told me to come the school, I felt smug that day. 

I really didn't know what to do with myself, I stopped playing football in middle school, because I didn't like it, and my body took a hit for it, I won't sugar coat it, I'm fat, I'm not the worse, like I'm 5’9 and 240ib, still obese, and I'm also incredibly shy, I will not answer phone calls that I don't know, I'll let them ring, then if they leave a voicemail I'll maybe call them back, this anxiety has been my source of dread for years, I hated looking for jobs, because of this, I hate working with people I don't know, I hate trying to order food in person, and I hate being this pathetic, this and the fact that I mumble and talk fast doesn't help, I naturally do this and it's sucks, and I can't pronounce my words correctly it's hard for me to pronounce Rs and THs, my Rs I leave out sometimes, and the THs turn into Fs so the word ""the"" becomes ""fhe"", and I always get asked to repeat myself which tears a hole in my chest each time.

So out of highschool I was 1.Fat 2.Shy 3.Lazy, I loved playing video games and was really big into lore and stuff, anyways I thought to myself ""what is one thing I could do to hopefully fixed this""…. Military, I joined the Navy, talk to my recruiter, one of nicest guys I met, I got a big bonus, went to meps that was tough but fine, went into the future sailor program for about 2 weeks, then went to boot camp… boot camp was both the scariest and stupidest thing I went through, I watched full metal jacket when I was a kid and I knew they toned it down, and also it wasn't the Marines, but Jesus was it simple I kept my head down so hard that my RDC forgot who I was at one point thinking I wasn't in the right division, I never got personally beat, of course the whole division got beat numerous times which I was apart of, but it's not the same as having a RDC watching you do push ups or 8 counts.

I did fail the physical test closer to the end, I forgot the name, surprisingly it was only on the push ups, I made it to I think 32 before my arms locked and I gave out, and my partner didn't give me slack, which is right, but man was I pissed at the time, I retested and past like two days later, and graduated with my division… 

Now let me explain to you what was probably the best time of my life, after boot camp I went to my A school, my rate was a ETV Electrician Technician Navigation, this is a submarine rate, I won't explain much because of reasons, but imagine being paid to go to school, this was my life for a year and half, I learn about my job, and I'm done for the day if I don't have duty, I made many friends from different states, then I graduated from A school to my C school, since I picked a boomer class sub (I was 2nd in placing), and this school was located at the bottom of Georgia , and Disney world, Universal were in Liberty range, and active military can get cheaper tickets, so me and a few of my buds had a blast…

I finally made it to my actual duty station, and that's when everything went to crap, I really learned about my job and I hated it, my fellow ETV’s were great, but that didn't help, and then my shyness got ahold of me again, I won't lie my shyness never went away, boot camp was a pump not a filter, and we always travel in groups so I never was leading, and I got by on just being there, so now I was on my own and I was terrified of looking dumb and talking to all the Chiefs and first classes, so I never finished my check in packet and they kinda forgot, so I got lucky.

My first and only deployment lasted about three weeks… for me, I was working kitchen like all new shipmates do, and I hated it, I hated so much because nothing could get done, I suck at dishes and cleaning, which yes I know they are easy, add it to the list on why I hate myself, and the drills, the drills is a all hands thing, doesn't matter if your supposed to be asleep, everyone participates, so I work 12 to 12 nights in the galley, and boy did I love going into a immediate drill after getting off, which btw they take hours to complete, also get this, I'm supposed to be qualifying fish, all submarines have to qualify fish, (look it up), so my senior is breathing down my neck to qualify, and I would love to go hunt down these fellas to do a check out with them, but I'm so shy that I'm too scared to do it… and this all was boiling inside me that it caused me to lose sleep… and I just wanted it to end, I needed to escape but I'm stuck under the ocean and I'm scared and I didn't want to let anyone down and pussy out, so I took a chair to a closed door area and tied my long charger to a pipe and I was going to do it, but I got scared I didn't know what would happen, I could only hope, I don't believe in God and I don't want to go to hell, and what if none of that happens, what if, what you wanted to happen, happens. I left the room and went to Doc, he got me med evacuated off the boat and I went to the ER for a bit, and then to therapy, I decided to get out and now I have just under two years of military service under me, it doesn't get me much, my friends treated me differently, they knew I was leaving, and gradually cut ties with me.

I come home to my room being given away to my sister who got a new boyfriend after the old one ditched her when she had his baby, I lived on the couch for a bit, not really wanting a job, but I couldn't stay on the couch, so me and my other sister got a house, I paid for the down payment with what was left of my bonus, and she had a job so it's in her name, I work with her in a nursing home, I'm a cook… I hate it, I’m pathetic, I gave up so much, I don't talk to my mom anymore, my dad lives in a different state and I barely talk to him, I got nothing for my service, I'm still lazy, still fat, and still shy, and I'm technically a veteran, but I don't feel like it, and I don't go to the VA… I hate myself, I want to die but can't bring myself to kill myself because I'm scared of death, I wish to die in my sleep, or in a accident, hell if I can lose my legs and get paid to stay home that would be great… my dream was to be a YouTuber or streamer, I loved watching Markiplier, Jacksepticeye,  DanTDM, VanossGaming, and so many more growing up, and that was my dream job, I bought the set up already before moving with my sister, and it's all set up here, with the exception that my room was smaller than expected but I made due with the space.

It's ironic isn't it, that's my dream job, with all my problems that's what I want to do… I want to be happy, but I don't see it happening, I know what I am and I hate it, and I'm too lazy to change it, and I want to die because of it, I'm a waste of space, I wasted so many opportunities and now I'm laying on my bed depressed, dreading tomorrow because I have to go to work… I hate myself.

a little over a year ago I tried suicide but before that I wanted to listen to Eminem so I did and after that I just stopped I m thinking about doing it for real this time 
And after writing this not even talking about it to a person I know in real life I now feel like I'm a narcissist just because of wasting time of anyone reading this and I think I should not have depression a lot people have experienced a lot worse lives than me and they were not depressed so I should not be depressed too I allwaysed had this fantasy that I get hurt really bad so others think of me

My life feels like a mess,"I’ve never really talked about stuff like this but I’ve hit a point where I feel like I need to tell someone. I’m 19m and I’m from Texas just to give some background. Tonight I was hit by a lot of emotions that have been building up over a long period of time. These past 2 years have been absolutely chaotic. 

Two years ago I moved out of my parents house to stay with my grandmother who is practically like my mother at this point. My parents have been so toxic and negative and harsh my whole life and I had enough of it and being there just made me feel worthless and uncared for. My grandmother who is divorced took me in and even though her house is falling apart and she doesn’t have much money, she did her best to make sure I was okay. I had also decided to move schools my senior year as I was being bullied and rumors had spread about me that weren’t true at I felt so alone and sad. Along that time my oldest sister who moved to Pennsylvania called me to let me know she was being abused and felt like her life was threatened so I drove my grandmother and I to get her and bring her back in 4 days and braved a blizzard, only for her to leave and go back 3 months later and cut contact with us months after that in May my father had a heart attack and I moved back with my parents to take care my younger sister and that situation caused so much conflict between my families. Then having to get two jobs while going to school full time to support my parents household and take care of my sister while dealing with ongoing family conflict and doctors telling me that my father is going to die and feeling so much regret. On top of that I was graduating high school and at my graduation only my grandmother showed up and it hurt me so badly because my entire family was there at the hospital arguing but couldn’t show up for me. It was so anticlimactic to walk the stage then go home and cry myself to sleep. 

While that situation resolved itself I had to drop out because I was still working two jobs and at this point just to support myself and my major required me to be at my classes which took place all day all week. Dropping out I lost access to my counselor who I spent so much time building trust and connection with and that was a big support system for me. Later that year (last fall) I started having conversations with my godparents who I never talked to and was told by my parents were terrible people. Turns out they weren’t and they took me in and fed me and housed me and gave me what I needed to live. Turns out my godmother was a lot like me growing up. Talking to her I made a lot of realizations about how my parents very much neglected me and mentally and sometimes physically abused me. Things I forgot and I assume my brain forced me to forget just so I could see my parents in a loving light. I feel like my whole life was a lie and everything I believed about myself and my family was a lie and I’m starting to see reality as what it really is. 

I’m in a stable household for the first time in a long time (or ever at all) and every instance of trauma in my life is coming back to me and times where I’ve forgotten when I’ve been abused or yelled at or neglected. I’m overwhelmed and mentally exhausted. I feel so unloved and uncared for and unimportant by everyone in my life other than the ones who directly helped me like my grandmother and my godparents. I feel like I can’t trust anyone anymore and I can’t even trust myself. The fact that I feel like my whole life was a lie makes me so upset and betrayed  that Im in disbelief that those things even happened. 

I’d like to go back to therapy but I don’t know if I can bear to explain my entire life story and have to go through trusting someone else again. I’m tired of everything and I feel lonely and stressed and angry and depression and defeated. I feel like I’ve lived an entire life time. I feel suicidal at times and I think about what I’d do, I wish a lot how I could just waltz into a forest and let the forest have my body and let it be of use to nature. I know deep down I could never do it but I always fantasize about it. I wish I could be free of my responsibilities and problems. I’m tired of crying and I’m tired of being tired.

Reddit and Politic/the News has wrecked my self-esteem and mental health,"Over the past 3 months, my self-esteem has completely collapsed—and I think a huge part of it is because of Reddit, Instagram, and the kinds of content I’ve been exposed to.

I’m visibly brown, Muslim, and of Pakistani ancestry. Before these past few months, I had insecurities here and there, sure—but I didn’t hate myself. I didn’t see myself as fundamentally lesser or unwelcome in the world, and I didn't feel inferior because of a lack of Caucasian-looking features. But after consuming so many comments, posts, videos, and discussions online, something has shifted in me in a really dark and painful way.

I now feel like I’m hated *everywhere* in the world —that no country, no community, no culture will ever fully accept me. My birthplace (Canada) has no career path for me in Aerospace (having a profession that's exclusive to a few countries doesn't help). My ancestral country doesn’t align with my values or have a future for me. And in the countries I really do love and check all of my boxes—like those in Europe—I’m convinced I’ll always be treated like an outsider or merely tolerated at best in the name of anti-racism etc until I'm not (and recent events in the US have made me realize how quickly the world can turn on you). These feelings and beliefs have become deeply ingrained into my psyche after seeing news content, YouTube influencer videos, and Reddit posts/comments which seem to confirm what I've said above.

Every comment I read online about Muslims, brown people, or Pakistanis really hurts and cuts a little deeper. I know I shouldn't internalize them, ignore it, etc but I can’t help it anymore. The hate feels real. The isolation feels permanent. I never felt this way in my life, but it's gotten to the point where I now have caught myself tacitly assuming people I meet in real life secretly dislike me or look down on me because of my background or appearance. That assumption is slowly poisoning my relationships, my confidence, and how I move through the world.

It’s also completely shattered my confidence in my appearance as a woman. I grew up in a Western country and I honestly never felt “ugly” or undesirable before because of my looks. But recently, I’ve found myself obsessing over not having Caucasian features—my face, skin tone, bone structure. I’ve started to think I look too “generic brown” to be liked, while wishing I had more Caucasian-looking features. 

A large chunk of the reason being because of all the negative stereotypes, comments, peoples beliefs, etc that I've read about people from my background or religion. My appearance clearly identifies my identity, and in turn everything I've read that confirms people like me are despised everywhere makes me hate my appearance. It’s made me pull back from forming friendships, expressing ideas at school or work, and it’s even made me feel like love and marriage are out of reach for someone like me.

On top of that, even when people are nice to me, I feel this intense paranoia that the second we disagree on anything or a cultural difference shows up—they’ll turn on me. Like the kindness is conditional, only ever temporary, or sort of in a ""forced"" tolerance/politeness kind of way.

A lot of what I feel seems confirmed by reality. I hate being intellectually dishonest or telling myself comforting lies, because it's a bandaid and doesn't address the real problems. When I look at the rise of anti-Muslim/anti-Brown politicians and rhetoric sweeping European elections, or just vitriol towards my religion/people of my appearance consistently topping every reddit post I look at, it confirms my beliefs as the truth and that's why it affects how I see the real world too. 

I never used to think this way. Reddit and the internet have warped my perception so much that I barely recognize how I see myself anymore. It feels like my identity has become a curse and it's changed my beliefs about myself and how I've viewed dramatically.

I guess… I just desperately want to feel welcomed somewhere. Like I can belong as my full self, with all of my identity. I don’t know how to get that back, if I can ever even do so.

Has anyone else gone through this? Have you felt your self-worth destroyed by online exposure or social media? Does this go away or have I poisoned myself in this way permanently?

These feelings really really suck and I really don't want to feel like this or be in this position anymore.

TLDR: Negative comments/hate about aspects of my identity as well as following global/world news and politics have demolished my self-esteem:

A) making me feel hated that my brown appearance ties me to negative/hateful stereotypes, and B) making me feel that the majority of the people in the world hate me and that no country in the world can ever be home.",depression,,Canada,61.0666922,-107.991707

I don’t know what to think or feel anymore,"Hello, I’m an 18 year old (F) and I’m just trying to figure out my life. My parents, whom I love with all my heart and soul, don’t love each other. They’re not divorced but ever since I was a kid I only see them arguing and that’s literally all they do. Somehow I always end up in the middle of it lol so it’s kind of annoying. I don’t want to sound corny or cringe but I never got support or advice on how to cope with that, so my brain literally just purposely forgets about it until I remember it again lol idk if it makes sense. But it affected my performance at school, and I know I shouldn’t let stuff like that affect me and let it stop me from doing what I’m supposed to, but it’s just so tiring seeing and knowing your parents hate each other. My dad comes and vents to me about mom, my mom comes and vents to me about him, it’s just so tiring. 

So they spent the last two nights arguing nonstop  and I overheard almost everything lol, they just argue about the same thing over and over again, and honestly I don’t blame my mom for feeling the way she feels because my dad isn’t the best husband or father. I heard him saying that he feels like we hate him so he’s distancing himself from us so that we can be happy. Which pissed me off by the way because the problem isn’t him being close to us, it’s him being far away from us because he works in another country and we see him every 2-3 months. And my mom is tired of that because all of the responsibilities is on her. I have 3 siblings btw and I’m the oldest, I’m trying my best to help. But obviously the house and the family  starts falling apart when the father isn’t present. The father is supposed to be what keeps us together and intact. A father is a leader and he’s not doing that. I worked with him for a couple of months and his job isn’t that demanding. 


Theres more to this but my point is, I’m tired, I don’t know what to feel, today the fight was pretty big and everyone was crying, I’m just so tired. Sorry for the yap and ty for reading, I’ll appreciate some feedback and advice. ",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
Unhappy and stuck in my family and area,"(28M) I’m autistic (high-functioning) and have OCD and depression, with undiagnosed anxiety. I’ve had a long, hard road socially and developmentally. I’m relatively lean and think I look decent, but I never got more than a short fling when I was 21 (ironically when I looked much worse). No relationships. I’ve been in college for a long time (now online) and have had to work full-time. The worst part is that I live in a small town in a southern state and can’t yet afford to move out from my grandmother’s house. She’s so obsessed with religion and expects me to be enthusiastically religious with her, despite me never praying or showing interest in attending church. Thankfully, I’m making quick progress with my program and anticipate finishing this summer, so I’ll be able to leave this dreadful region for a large northeastern city this fall. But I still feel so down. So many people my age have had great relationships, numerous vacations, and great jobs. And so many people on Reddit seem to live in advanced, liberal US cities. It’s unfair because it’s easier to afford to live in such cities if you start in them like all these people do. And my family always disregards my feelings about this area and what I want in life (no kids, to live in a large northeastern city). And there’s no way to make friends here, it’s very clique-based.

"Need help, currently wondering if i have depression and doubting/confused about if everything i ever felt troughout my life is real.","I don't ask for sympathy nor wanna seem like i'm a victim, i, like everyone else, did shit that i regret in the past and altough i don't feel pressured about it i still find myself feeling guilty for this and that.

I also don't wanna see people thinking i'm doing or writing this for attention, it's guaranteed that there are people going trough the same right now and i feel like saying things such as ""he just wants attention"" disregards not only my concerns but the experiences of others, please keep the comments respectfull.

If you have any questions or want more details about certain parts of my life story or my point of view please let me know, i left out big big parts not only due to my memory but because i'd be here all night writing and this already took me 1 hour and an half.

This can be considered a venting post since i don't have the courage to talk about this with any person i know, i'm scared of what they might think and i also want help from more experienced people on this in a  psychological and cientific manner.


Context about myself:

Hello, i'm a 19 year old man who is currenty dealing with confusion about his emotions, identity and wants to share his point of view.

I'm currently unemployed, i study music and thinking of going to college this year.

I prefer simplicity over complexity, while people may enjoy doing activities which are considered much more interactice i simply like walking aroundz talking abiut certain things and just resting in a bench or a park while talking and just seeing others enjoying the moment.

I always liked to help people and understand them before judging, i also like to talk a lot and i usually phrase what i want to say in big detail which i have been criticised for.

I like arts, hearing people talk about what they like, games, deep convos and reflecting on things that may not be spoken about so commonly.

I have difficulty iniciating a conversation and meeting new people altough i usually don't have any probles speaking with them if theynstart the conversation first.

My life story:

I've lost my innocence at a very young age, had an abusive father and a mother that had to work everyday to make me happy.

 Because of not getting the attention i needed as a child i ended up creating a dependance on fast food and games which made me obese at a very young age, this of course left me with an appearance that made it difficult to make friends which impacted how i act socially to this day, i got bullied and neglected by society to the point where even people that got involved would be called disgusting and would also be misstreated. I ended up making a friend, a black kid which i really liked, he treated me nicely even if people saw him as someone disgusting because of me, he ended up going to  a school in Angola, Africa after a year which made me say my first ever goodbye at 5 years of age.

Troughout my 4 years in primary school i managed to make 3 friends, 1 of them was a bit more distant ehile the other 2 had the same interests, i got to know these 2 specifically when the game Five Night's at Freddy's released and, altough i was happy when i was with them i always felt my life didn't ""have color"" to the point i literally started being unable to see color in things like the blue sky (which i perceived as a less-glowing blue) and most colors at the time felt ""greyish"" to me, not sure if there's something cientific related, if so please let me know as i would like to understand a bit more about myself.
The bullying continued as usual, kids would sometimes spit on me, i couldn't go to the cantheen or people would throw food at me so i started having lunch at home, got my front teeth broken and removed because of a kid who punched me, was minding my own business and got pushed from a very high place which traumatized me and now i can't be on high places with people behind me,  while everyone had their notebooks handed to them mine would be thrown at the desk in a way to avoid contact with both the notebook and me.

My grandpa (which was my father figure all my life) died when i was 7 which made me feel numbness, it also made me aggressive and i had to go to a psychologist.

Starting my 5th year it got even worse since my mother separated from my father, i didn't have any friends, people took advantage of me asking me for money falsely promissing to be friends with me only to ignore me each chance they had unless i had money to give them.
People from my class would constantly pinch me and make fun of my mom and wanted to switch schools.

6th grade was when i finally regained the ""color"" in my life and i finally made true friends that still are in my life today and are very important to me, they stick with me trough my lows but i don't have the courage to spill everything that goes on my mind cause i don't wanna be a bother to them even tho i am very talkative and get criticized for it a lot.

2020 was the best year in my life since i was able to lose weight and be happy with myself, i ran faster than ever and felt an adrenaline i didn't know was even possible, this i'm sure was the last time in my life i ever felt true honest happiness.

On 9th grade however i got into a severe depression which made me miss 6 months of school, get to 110kg and almost lose my friends, this impacted me completely and it's by far the worst year in my Life.

In highschool only one of my friends stayed in the same school as me and i still felt depressed altough i felt like i was getting better, i also had something that adults called ""sad eyes"" at the time, at that time my eyes were naturally dead so to say, i baaically had the face of someone who didn't care about life or anything in general, still i saw that people cared about me so i did an effort in order to change and to this day i forcefully create a normal look even tho i still have that face when i'm alone (i'm like that right now in case you're curious).

I made an effort and ended up losing 30 pounds which landed me on 80KG, i later got to 70 which is the ""normal"" weight for my height.

I finished Highschool, graduated now i'm here.


What i realised about mu life and how i feel nowadays:

What i came here to talk about mainly is how i feel like, after reaching adulthood, i realised that i had depression for my entire life and not just after 9th grade.

I have everything to be happy, good friends, a mom that cares and supports me in everything she can, an appartment that i will inherit, i'm good at music and have a thing called ""perfect pitch"" which is almost a cheat code, i don't suffer from any finantial problems and have everything i always want even if it takes time.

Altough it might sound bad, i hate myself and i simply can't live with myself, i see what i am and it feels me with disgust and sadness seeing how if someone else was chosen they would be way better than me at just living life and just enjoying the life i have to the fullest.
I constantly think of being killed as i honestly don't have the courage to kill myself, i don't know if any of the emotions i ever felt besides sadness and numbness were even real, i'm currently having difficulties feeling and even smiling at my friends, when i laugh i'm always conscious and it feels like i'm just faking it even tho i'm not.

I'm just having trouble understanding if what i feel is even true at this point, if i can even feel emotions with 100% honesty and not only it makes my head hurt it keeps me awake at night, i'm just a 19 year old guy, i don't know what i'm doing and even if i'm emotionally stable and this is normal since everyone deals with their own shit and most of them doesn't like to tell, also, i find it easier to live life when i erase emotions completely since i stop feeling fear.

Just came here to talk about this cause i'm starting to recover some memories, good and bad, and i also want to know if it's worth it seeing a therapist or this is just stupidity of me or i am being childish.

If you read this, sorry for taking your time and thanks for your attention.

If you are going trough ghe same experience as me feel free to share since i have lots of time and do nothing with it.

My depression destroyed everything,"I love her. I love her more than anything in the world. The three years we have spent together I’ve felt safe, loved, comforted, and cared about. We had our issues, and we both hurt each other, but shes never left my mind as the most beautiful perfect shining light in this world and my motivation to secure a good life for not just myself but the both of us. I transitioned very early into our relationship, because no one had ever made me feel so comfortable and confident to be myself, and shes helped me every step of the way.  

All of this, and my stupid piece of shit brain still wants me to die. It never ends. I should be so fucking happy, I AM so happy because I have everything I could realistically want. My stupid fucking brain demoralizes me and sets me back, and made me neglect her and lash out and not be the partner she deserved. I know I’m that girl. She’s my fucking treasure and I’ve seen her grow so much over our relationship and all of my goals in life have her in it. But it’s too late. I’ve stomped on and ruined her heart, and I didn’t even want to. Everything making me hate myself just made her want to move on. I had a chance to move us to Colorado, we could see all the metal shows we miss out on, make more money, find fellowship in community, experience the world, go to the cool bars and try all sorts of new food, in a state with growth and career opportunities for both of us. I know it would have been perfect but she’s only seen me rot and can’t trust me to make her happy. I understand it completely but it hurts so bad that this disease in my brain fucked up all I’ve ever wanted.",depression,,Colorado,38.7251776,-105.607716
Ectopic pregnancy and Disney…,"This is gonna probably seem bratty but it’s bothering me. In September I had to have emergency surgery to remove an ectopic pregnancy in my left fallopian tube. We had planned a vacation to Panama City beach, FL.  2 days later we left for the beach… I was tired and sore, but I was excited as the pregnancy news came as a surprise(I only found out 5hrs before surgery and was bleeding internally) and I didn’t have time to process anything. While we were there I got excited and thought of the idea to go to Disney World (happiest place on earth, right?) I looked it up and it was gonna be about $600 to go for a day and get a room to stay in. It was a 6hr drive there and honestly, just wanted to eat a Mickey bar in front of the castle wearing some ears and maybe ride the small world ride. That is literally all I wanted out of that. It was a little thing that I thought would make me happy. I talked it over with my husband and I wanted to go so bad but I didn’t want to spend all that money for a day and he didn’t want to drive the 6hrs. He reminded me we said we would go in February for a week and it was okay to not go for a day just after surgery. Fast forward to now… we don’t have the money to go anymore and I didn’t get that day… I keep trying to tell myself it’s stupid and it’s expensive but in reality I was really excited and kinda heartbroken over it. It was the part I wanted out of the trip and we had originally planned to go to both but changed at last minute and we’re gonna go in February for a week instead . I hate sand but love the sound of the ocean and I had fun but I was exhausted. I was sore and walking through the sand was annoying and hard. I’m not mad we can’t go I’m just upset over it. My family (husband and daughter) enjoy the beach. Don’t get me wrong I had fun and I’m thankful for the time but I just feel kinda robbed… that was a lot all at once to process and I didn’t get that day and now I don’t get to go at all. He said we could go next year but I’m not holding my breath for it because it is just getting more and more expensive. I don’t know… I feel like a brat because many don’t get to even do that..I just am sad over it. I also have had another surgery since then to remove my other fallopian tube and I’ve been kinda a wreck. It was never that I didn’t want more kids…it was that pregnancy was hard and my mental health got worse after my daughter and I was diagnosed as bipolar with depression and anxiety. I think I mostly did it so that would never happen again. I was terrified of getting pregnant again and it happened and I couldn’t process it or even make the decision for myself what we would do… it was all decided for me in a matter of hours. Sorry for this long post. I needed to vent I guess.",depression,,Panama City,30.1586518,-85.6602936

Final Try,"Second attempt because my first one got taken down. i just wanted to reach out.

15M. I don’t deserve anybody, i don’t deserve you reading this. It’s horrible when i resort to something like this just for someone to listen to me. I hate myself. Ever since the 5th grade when i failed for the first time. I’m 6th grad ei started getting bullied for the way i look, in 7th my grades only kept declining and i had basically nobody. I finally made a couple friends nearing the end of the year, but one of them couldn’t go a day without commenting on my appearance for cheap jokes. I had to ask him to please stop, and he didn’t get why it affected me so much. I got my first crush the next year. Although, i had started liking her for a while before that, i just never had thought of her like that. I think i stopped myself. But even though he knew, he knew i liked her, he started liking her too. He liked her way after i did. He didn’t care. He announced it on Christmas day to the entire friend group. He ruined my Christmas that year. I hated him. I hated him. I couldn’t look him in the eye, so i tried to stop talking to him. It was so hard to avoid him because i saw him everyday, and he never understood what he did wrong. I eventually forced myself to forgive him after a couple months. I felt like i was hurting myself more if i tried not to. My self-image has never recovered since those events. The bullying persists and nothing gets better. He eventually broke up with her. And got with a girl a couple months after. And eventually they actually both helped me get a girlfriend. Although he tried rushing us and almost sabotaged us. He was still confused, said he was just trying to help. She broke up with me two weeks later, because she said she was desperate for a boyfriend so she picked me. I didn’t cry. I didn’t cry, because i can’t. I can never cry and i don’t know why i can’t. I didn’t cry when my family member died, i didn’t cry when i hurt myself for the first time, and i didn’t cry when she broke up with me. A couple months before this though, i had gotten extremely close to one of my friends. I’ll use “G” to refer to him. And i felt like he was the only one i could trust. I remember he started hanging out with this one friend i never heard of, i’ll use “D” to refer to him. I noticed he was spending a lot of time with him. I got kind of nervous. I was scared he would leave me. I was scared he would abandon me. I began to resent D for it. I hated him and made it clear i did whenever he joined call or something. He didn’t go to our school. It wasn’t until i had a long late night conversation with him one day (and i learned he was actually a childhood friend of G), that i realized i was being stupid. As time went on, i became close with him too. They were really my only friends i felt like cared about me. I even began to get over my ex. I started to notice this one girl in my class and it helped me take my mind off of the bad things. Like me failing. Or past experiences. I didn’t know her that well. I wanted to be her friend. But he had to ruin it. The boy that ruined my life. I never gave him a name. “J”. I’ll use that. He talked to her. He made her panic and she admitted that she would never date me. He ruined something before it ever even started. I hate him. It was the last straw. I couldn’t believe it. He didn’t see what he did wrong. He never does. I hate him. He made me hate myself. He made me feel worthless. He made me hurt myself. I hate him. He broke up with his second girlfriend because he felt like he never liked her like that. So he realizes that after nine months of dating her. I felt so bad for her. He doesn’t care about people’s feelings. He cares about himself, and he will never feel the consequences of his actions. But i feel the consequences of being alive. I lost my ability to cry. I lost my ability to sleep. I keep myself up by replaying everything that happened and blaming myself. I hate it. I fall asleep in class. I fail school. When my body forces me to sleep i dream horrible dreams. The one i remember the most is one where i saw the whole world die. My friends G and D died horribly. My family died horribly. I saw billions of people die and it was all my fault. All i could do was scream. I don’t deserve anything anymore. I know my parents care but i don’t feel it. They have such a i love you mentality that they hate me. I hate everything. I push away the last people that care about me. G and D. I’m pushing them away. I want them to hate me. I want to be hated so when i leave i won’t have a remaining memory. I want to be forgotten. I started talking to J’s ex because she came into contact with me so we could share our horrible experiences with him.  we called every single day since then. I never thought of her that way until i dreamt about her. I hated myself for it. I never deserved to think of her romantically. But apparently after a month or two of talking, she cared about me a lot. She was telling me how much she cared about me and that i was her favorite person. It made me cry. It didn’t hurt to cry that day. They didn’t burn. I confessed to her after that. She said she liked me too, but wanted to wait after all the past experiences. I get it, i went through a bad ex not too long ago too. I wish i never confessed. I wish i never did. I ruined everything when i did. She likes me too. But she doesn’t think she’s in the right mental to get into a relationship. But she got a boyfriend. She got with the boy i helped her get over. Why can’t i have anything. I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED I HATE MYSELF I HATE MYSELF I WANT TO DIE I CANT HAVE ANYTHING I DONT DESERVE IT I WANT EVERYONE TO JUST ADMIT THEY HATE ME WITHOUT TIPTOEING AROUND ME TO NOT HURT ME. JUST HATE ME SO I CAN DIE EASIER. IM OBSESSED WITH SLICING MYSELF NOW BECAUSE NOBODY CARES ANYMORE. IM SORRY G AND D BUT I WANT YOU TO HATE ME. MUSIC ISNT APPEALING TO ME ANYMORE, I USED TO LISTEN TO IT 24/7. GAMES ARENT APPEALING. NOTHING MAKES ME HAPPY. KILL ME BEFORE I DO. it’s all my fault. everything is my fault. I ruin everything. I hurt everyone. I just want to leave so i won’t hurt anyone. So i won’t hurt anymore. I’m failing school and i always will. I try my best. I don’t want to try anymore. Nobody will love me ever. I can’t open up to my parents. I went to the doctor. they forced a therapist on me. Even if i don’t, my teachers will tell on me. Now i need medication. I want to be normal. i don’t know why i’m typing anymore. Nobody will care to read. Nobody will care to help. Nobody could help me anymore. I want someone to love me. I just want love.

I’m so sad,"Hello, 17 live in Va and have been going through a very rough two months. I quit high school two years ago because I have crippling social anxiety and have been carrying instant gratifying habits for a while now. I recently started talking to a girl and I’ve learned I’m more of an overthinker than I was aware of. I get obsessed way too fast, and then unbeknownst to them I give them full access to my thoughts and feelings having them live in my head rent free. Things were going well for a month, and then It just died out and received mixed signals, for a time it was the happiest I’d been in my life. So now Ive turned into an avoidant out of self preservation and now I feel like an asshole for taking hours to reply to them, always have been to a certain extent with my peers but wasn’t expecting it to be this way with this person. The limerance is real… So I get in these states of just utter sadness and hopelessness and I start having suicidal thoughts basically thinking I’m not good enough and have no motivation to do anything. I think I’ve been cursed, maybe I did this to myself, Idk maybe I’m autistic but I do know my self esteem has been low since middle school and never feel comfortable in my own skin unless I’m in a solitary environment or on a walk at 3:00 am at night. I have no desire to socialize with people and am not ready for a relationship let alone friendships because I don’t love myself, I’m emotionally mature and a good person never put others down and am very nice to everyone I meet but feel like that just hurts me more in the end when I give people my all. When I get in these states I just can’t self regulate, I sit in the sadness and just don’t want to feel this pain in my heart. I have people to talk to but it doesn’t help, it’s not going to change my thought process. So I don’t know why I came on here to vent, this is the equivalent of writing smth in notes app since it’s really just a long paragraph of self pity and not at all open ended. I don’t know maybe other people can relate I’m sorry not trying to make myself a burden for anyone I’m my own responsibility but tips on how to get better and stop caring would be helpful I hear meditating is good, finding hobbies, and how do I get the motivation to do these things.",depression,,Va,41.903411,12.4528527
I never felt this way before? Could it be depression?,"I believe this is depression, I’m turning 27 next month and I am not happy about turning 27. I used to be excited about my birthday every year but this year, it feels different.

On reprieve...,"Hello everyone,

I'm going to post something not very original to you.  I am a 28 year old French man, homosexual. I'm in the middle of depression. I have always been very negative but now I am hitting rock bottom. 

I have a job, a place to live, a little money aside, I have nothing to complain about, but happiness is not there.

I am deeply alone. My life has no meaning. Very few friends, no lovers.  I tried dating apps but it doesn't work, the relationships are quite superficial. 

I want to write goodbye letters. What’s stopping me from taking action are my mom and my sister… I lost my dad to cancer 5 years ago, it’s going to be very difficult for my mom. I couldn't think about ending my life while my dad was sick, then I put it off because of my sister's marriage, then the birth of my niece. We have a family trip at the end of April/beginning of May. After this trip I have no plans this year and I think this will be the ideal time to think about that.  

I don't want to be selfish and only think about myself, but if you only knew how deep my pain is. Weekends, evenings, vacations are my obsession. Too much time for me... eating alone, living alone, an empty apartment, a round table and 4 chairs that are often empty, a set of 12 plates and cutlery that I never use... I rarely take time off because I don't know what to do with all this time alone and it terrifies me. 

I'm 28 years old and I don't dare imagine living the next 20, 30, 40 years like this. Fed up with this routine, waking up, eating, working, sleeping, shopping, cleaning. For whom? Why do all this? 

I am learning about the different ways of dying. I would like not to fail, I don't want to find myself in the hospital, chained to a bed and be followed by people for life. 

I went to see a psychologist last year for 2 months, every week. It was nice to talk to someone from outside without fear, but I realized that I was spending money for nothing :/

Forgive me dear network for this lack of originality and these many lines.

I give up,"Hey

22f here

I have depression , bpd , ptsd & autism.
I stopped school because of a beginning burn out. I can finally say I'm in the right therapy for that. Its focused on bpd habits. 

Now I've been struggling with health problems. I lost 40kgs in 8months because of it. For 7-8months they saw ptsd & bpd ...and they thought it was stress. Now I've been to the er last weekend. Also saw bpd & thought stress. Now I did an echo and bloodwork. My gallbladder has stones, my pancreas and liver aren't good. And they think I have mcas. I haven't eating in 5days because if I eat...I get very sick. I live on aquarius and the fortimel drinks. 
I'm so traumatized by getting sick because of food. Now they told me its probably forever. I wanna give up. I dont wanna have this pain forever. I think I'm kms soon. I give up. This isn't the life I want. This isn't the life my partner deserves. I'm sure my partner will find a healthy geeky girl that isn't a fuck up like me. My parents dont really care they abused me for years. I don't really have close friends. Friends that you see a few times a year . I won't be missed. I won't be in pain anymore. Maybe In another lifetime I wont be this sick in the head & body. 

Sounds very pessimistic ..i know...
But everytime something new happends. I know thats life. But I dont want that life. I tried , I really did try. But I dont enjoy anything anymore in life. All I do is complain. All I do is cry and be angry. I became my mom lol. I cant do a household bcs of not getting food in my system, I cant work out, I cant eat , I dont make my parents or partner happy, im a burden...and the guilt is so high, I cant work bcs of mental health, I cant keep friends/ relationships, I'm a fuck up. 
I don't bring joy to my loved ones. I dont even bring joy to myself. So why would I live on? ",depression,,bpd,-23.53777205,-46.73598396295546
"Young Adult, struggles with motivation, driving, S.I","Half vent, half looking for advice rn

I (18F) am almost done with my senior year of HS and for whatever reason I’m terrified of driving - I know have to do it/learn, I tell myself it’s because I have no motivation and I’m terrified bc of my own overthinking and S.I- I’m in therapy but I started before I was 18 so I didn’t share my S.I thoughts - I realize I probably should and I’ve only told my partner about it (17, almost 18 Non-Binary). I’ve told them about most of those problems but I feel like unless I come right out and say it they just think I’m venting and not that I’m spiraling or overthinking or struggling with S.I and other thoughts..

The main problems that I feel have been a part of my depression have been loneliness, overthinking, people pleasing those who don’t love me (ex: feeling ignored in my band class by band mates even when I’ve tried to help/often advice to younger members, over gets overlooked for other seniors or those who are better players).

Is it ok/valid that I’ve been struggling with learning/wanting to drive and motivation after feeling ignored by those I love? Should I force myself to drive to do other stuff even if I’m terrified of messing up or overthinking or being so worried that I spiral and lose focus and then something bad does happen-",depression,,S.I,41.95920355,12.466086994620502
Finally thinking of getting help!,"24 F
I cannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnot do therapists (I have given this enough thought btw). I talk about my problems with the people in my life, mostly with my boyfriend and my best friend. Both great listeners and help me when I need attention. Lately I’m realizing that everytime I talk to them I only talk about my problems. They haven’t complained at all but I assume it must be tiring. Another thing I’ve felt is that there’s a level of disconnect when the person you’re talking to has no idea how anxiety or depression feels like. I feel like this is one of the emotions that only the people who’ve felt it understand. 
A little background:
What I’m doing rn-
senior in college, completely dislike my major, have no interest in pursuing this as a career, started performing significantly worse in school. 
Who I’m doing-
My cute bf who live 1000+ miles away from me 
Who I live with-
My mom whom I really love. Don’t have any family related issues.
Who I hangout with-
My best friend mostly. Have a decent social life. Not much of a social person.

Okay I’m getting to the main point. Finally!!!
My life doesn’t seem bad when reading things about me, right?? Even the people I know personally have no idea that I’m becoming more and more depressed everyday. It started in 2020 during the COVID time. I moved continents with my mom and the first couple of years were absolute shit. Something significantly bad used to happen every month. There wasn’t a day I didn’t cry. Everything was shit. Tooooo much for a 20 year old to handle. On new years eve 2021, I made a promise to myself that I would do a 360 degree change to my life. Started school and made some new friends. The entire lifestyle changed and I started getting healthier. I wasn’t the relationship type back then. I basically did whatever I wanted to. Went out on dates with a lot of different people, tried to explore anything that was in front of me. 2023-2024 started going through something major finances related. However, it wasn’t that I was struggling with money but it was a huge financial loss. It started affecting my mental health again. 2023 is also when I fell in love with the man of my dreams. For two years this financial problem kept bothering me everytime I was awake. I started doing bad in school too. I started having same episodes I once did. My life got fucked yo again. Fast forward to 2025 something major happened in February college and academics related that has made me realize that I suck at everything in my life. Since I have hidden all my problems the readers won’t understand the depth of the issues that happened. But to summarize these 5 years included issues related to someone’s death, finances, school, friends and partner. I have lived for 24 years but honestly feels like 40 with the shit that I go through.
Okayyyy now the reason behind this post.
I feel like there’s people here that go through random breakdowns daily. It has been happening to me more than ever. I cried inside a parking lot today for absolutely no reason for context. So I am looking for someone to do a daily battery check. Basically in the morning and at night. Talk twice a day if possible. My time zone is Central FYI. During these checks, we could tell each other what our current social/psychological battery is in the morning for that day, or how many breakdowns happened that day. Basically the things I would want to tell to people who understand and won’t judge rather than bothering my friends. If anyone’s like me DM me :)
Sorry I wrote so randomly and as if this is not a serious issue. Humor has been my coping mechanism for years now and that has made me a very unserious person. Thank you! It was fun venting. Also, I love everyone that’s reading this❤️.",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
I’ve lost almost everything and I’ve given up on my life,"The first time I had a major depressive episode I worked extremely hard to pull myself out. Seven years later and I’ve had some ups, but mostly downs, and the trend has definitely been down. I’ve progressively lost most of the things that matter to me (my hobbies due to injury and most of my close relationships) despite working tirelessly to improve my circumstances. At this point, I’m experiencing somewhat of a ”senoritis” effect in my life. I have no motivation to work hard to create a happy life for myself because my efforts over all these years have failed. I’m 25 and I truly don’t have a vision for my future. I feel that subconsciously I know that I will die by suicide soon but have not quite come to terms with it fully?

Tonight i'm going to kill myself,"My name is Gian and i'm from Peru, unfortunately the last you will hear from me is that I made a post on Reddit before ending my life.
I'm 22 years old and I study Software Engineering, the beginning of my depression started when my father started abusing me since I was 7 years old, I told my mom about it when I turned 18, if I'm honest with myself, I never made my mom proud during my whole life, it was something I always wanted to do, I'm not going to lie, I was making it or so I thought, since I started studying at my university I became more responsible, I learned to love myself more and focus on what's important.
My dad located me and beat me at the time of departure at my university, he broke my glasses.
To make matters worse, next week is my graduation, I have a failed course that I have to pay for or I won't be able to graduate as an engineer.
I'd rather slit my wrists right now than see my mom disappointed in me and have her tell me ""you're still the same irresponsible guy.""
This course is not even a course that I studied, the university forces you to look for a company and work without pay for 6 months, I couldn't get a company and now I'm screwed and without money to pay for that damn course :(
I have seen my mom cry many times and it has always broken my heart, I was always taught since I was little that a man should never cry, that doing that is faggy, for the first time in my life I am venting here, I am fucked and there is no solution for this, if you read this mom: ""I'm really sorry and i love You""

I destroy my dad,"I struggle with depression. 

I have goals and I am am/was an ambitious person. I know what my goals in Life are, but I am so far away from being the same person that set these goals. My Illness robbed me of that, I know what I want. people tell me i need to find what makes me happy and it will be ok again, but I know what I want. Its right infront of me but I cant reach it. My father spend his life in farming and making us a home, I want to continue that. It has been my goal since I was 16, I sepnd a lot of my life learing and gathering expiriance in that field. Now I am Ill. The nature of that Job is deemanding and my father sees my Illness and feel like its not foe me and maybe I destroyed myself trying to do something I dont want to do. 

I dont know how to get out of this. I worked away from home most of my life. And people fell like being home is the problem for me. I am this close to my goal, and people think it is my home that destroys me. I cant explain how i am feeling, its either bad or nothing maybe a mix of those. My job keept me above a lot of it for a long time (high functioning deppesion) but I wasnt home at that time and now people close te me or close to my home and family think that me being back is the reason behind it. I cant tell them their wrong without being better cause they dont belive me. But this often leads to unwanted advice that I know is not true, I try to work on my problems (therapy and Clinic soon)

But whats hurts me the most is to see my father break right in front of me he wont tell me but I see it. He trys his best to help me even offering to kill the farm (3 generations of work) just to make me feel better, even tho to keep his legacy alive is my biggest goal in life. Being half the man he is would be great. He feels like he did me wrong and presure me to much, he wants to hide it from me but I see how it kills him inside that he wasnt able to raise me right. 

To see him with those thaughts and not being able to better myself fast enough to help him hurts. 

He does all he can to help me and at the same time challenge me to do at least somethin, he doesnt understand deppresion but tries to, he doesnt give up, hes the reason I will keep fighting this battle. If I dont win he would take it on his shoulders.

How could I leave my father with that, it keeps me fighting but at the same time i cant watch him carry me anymore. How could I ever repay this man for what he did and for what he would do for me. 

Why do I love and hate him for that at the same time.

In the end I am deeply sorry for what I do to him.

like i have some symptoms but they're not that severe.... i have had my fair share of mental issues.few years ago i was pretty sad- can't remember much but i used to do minor sh. honestly i think it was for attention i guess i was somewhat passively suicidal but i was desperate for attention even though i was loved. this july i kinda. got worse i guess. started sh more and worse(anything would be worse compared to years ago though)got less frequent after summer. felt really inhuman and like an alien to a large degree(autism i guess) felt like i was going insane every day i was in a dark spot then. don't worry it gets worse. a lot worse. i got an ed from sep to dec im fine now but the only reason i stopped sh then was cuz i was too tired from ed to do anything. cant tell much then cuz idk what was actually mental or ed effects but i was pretty mentally bad too. after dec i got bad headache and dizziness standing up(after covid vaccine? not sure if it's from that or possible depression) so many tests docs said it was depression or anxiety.... don't have bad anxiety. thing is the past few months i feel like im going crazy i think im going insane also my stomach started hurting some what bad and i keep waking up in the middle of the night a couple weeks ago. i am soooo bored all the time and the only things that really cure it or give me happiness are meals and reading specific stuff(it's getting boring now my interest is fading) i am so bored nearly all the time i want to get up but i feel physically unwell to do anything for an extended amount of time... started feeling actually crazy for a few weeks now but i guess i wasn't really thinking about it a couple months ago. can't sh anymore and im not actively suicidal anymore i just feel like im going crazy and insane and everything is horribly boring and i dont really wanna do anything that much. i am happy sometimes but i am just bored most of the time like i wanna do stuff but im tired and i dont really wanna do anything? i just feel like im going crazy and nothing really helps and i just lie in bed all day i just feel like im going insane..... i don't feel a sense of deep sadness or suicidal ideation i just feel insane and crazy and bored and tired most of the time.... im repeating myself i could probably go on a rant about how inhuman i feel and how i basically bedrotted most of the day for a few years now but can't remember anything last year. i also feel incredibly washed out and faded i used to have potential but now i just dont really wanna do anything and i used to be great but now im just kinda useless now idk what happened to me ",depression,,kinda,57.9946553,15.8926885
thank you to anyone who reads this,"I feel like I’m going to lose my mind. I wish I had friends to go out with, people who would give me courage and experience life with me so I wouldn’t be so nervous. I know I can only blame myself, but I’m just so upset. I wish things were different for me.

Today, my sister told me that my mom wanted to talk to me about something, but she acted weird about it, like she didn’t want to say what it was about even though i kinda already knew. When I went to see what my mom wanted and sat on the couch, she started talking about how i will need to do more chores/cleaning now that my sister would be working soon and wouldn’t be home much anymore because of high school, college courses, programs, and work. I already figured that would happen. It just makes sense.

But then my sister came downstairs and just stood there listening, even though, to my knowledge, my mom had only asked to speak to me. It made me uncomfortable. Then my mom started saying how I don’t do anything, how she works, how my sister does a lot, and then asked, “Do you think taking on more chores is too much for you?” Like… what? Of course not. But the way she says it, I just sit at home doing nothing, hurt. I know it’s true, and I hate it. Every day, I feel sad about it. Every night, I think about it. But when I try to express that, my mom just says I’m being defensive. The way she talks down to me makes me feel so small, and my younger sister just stood there listening. Then my mom said the conversation was for both of us, but everything she was saying was directed at me.

I always wanted to go to college. Ever since I was 15, I dreamed about it. I’d watch YouTube videos of freshmen sharing their experiences and think, maybe someday that’ll be me. But it wasn’t. I spent the last few years of my life inside my room.

I had so many dreams traveling with friends, going out on holidays and summer breaks, visiting cafes and malls together but none of it ever happened. I didn’t make it happen for myself. I wish I had someone to do it all with, someone to push me, and I’d push them too. It’s less scary when you’re not alone.

But a huge part of why I feel this way, why I have so much anxiety, is because of my weight. I’ve been insecure about it for as long as I can remember, but now it affects me more than ever. I don’t even like going places because I feel ashamed, like people are judging me. I feel like I can’t live unless I lose weight. I wanted to be that beautiful girl in college, the one with friends and a life, but I’m not. I know I’m too sensitive, I know I lack discipline, and I know I’m not strong enough for this world. Each year, I lose more hope and waste more time. I only see myself getting worse i don’t think i can keep doing this i don’t see a future for me.

I’m sorry if this is all over the place i just had to tell someone.",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
What is a sign you probably need to be medicated?,"Hey!
I think this is my 2nd or 3rd time posting here-

Anyways, as the title says, what are signs you probably need to be on antidepressants or something? I've been considering more and more on getting therapy because I'm realizing and can't keep living like this when going into adulthood as I'll be setting myself up for failure or take the easy way out (which is very tempting). 

While I'm considering therapy I'm also concerned I'm probably going to be prescribed antidepressants. While there's wrong with that per se, I'm the kind of person who hates taking medicine, rather I don't want to rely on it unless necessary (even pain killers). I'm also worried about the side effects, which I don't want to deal with genuinely. I'm aware it varies but it's a concern of mine. Another thing I worry about is how I'll change if I do take them. Will my personality be different? What about my way of thinking? I will say my constant isolation made me very observant of others and highly self aware, also giving me a ton of thoughts and ideas (not necessarily negative), I'm afraid that'll go away or change if I take anything. Maybe I'm also worried over nothing as I've been having depression for years that I think it's my personality because of how imbedded it is in me. I barely remember how I was like before I developed it, it seems completely foreign.

I would like to try to overcome it alone if possible, without anything. Willing for therapy. I've done a bit of research and self reflection to try to plan it out. Like for example, I notice I'm much more motivated and in a better mood when I'm outside and it's a bright and sunny day (likely do to me not going out much). I could start learning to exercise as I never did it nor tried, which would better my mental and physical health. Could try to eat better foods if I can afford it, instead of a bunch of microwavables and snacks (could lay off the sugary stuff...sigh). I think that would be a start?

At least something to help before I go to college. Kinda worried how I'm gonna deal with work and stuff a long with motivation. Perhaps a matter of discipline, hoping those things I listed will motivate me more to do work. But even still I question if that will be enough or will it be better if I actually just take medication + those methods o listed....last resort. I'd at least want to try those methods first before I resort to getting medicine.

I don't know. Am I being stupid and overthinking? It would ease my mind a bit to hear you guy's experience with medication and the effects it had on you and how you dealt with your depression (especially when you have work/school) <:)",depression,,Kinda,57.9946553,15.8926885

He barely visited us when he was still staying in the same country as us but he affords to catch flights and visit 2year old twins who will barely remember him from the 3rd wife...so life after my parents divorce was tough and it pushed me to grow up quickly and if there are any Africans here they understand what I'm talking about. I had to be the mother my little sister didn't have and literally everything our household needed (the mechanic for our car, the maid, the gardener, the fast thinker) my mother was going through great depression at the time and I had to make sure that we pulled through and I did as she didn't want to talk to anyone and she'd stay in her room for hours sometimes putting the TV on and just staring at it even until the movie finishes without even processing or watching the movie but she eventually got out of it. Over the years that role has stuck with me being the literal parent to both my mother and sister but now I'm tired infact I've been tired a long time ago because I never experienced being a child and it took a toll on me to the point that I've tried committing suicide 8 times since I was 14. From 14 my mums mood swings started and all the rage and anger she felt for my father and even any situation she'd take it out on me and my sister always got the better end of the bargain because my mum would always baby her saying she needs most of the love as she was just 6 or 7 years when my parents divorced so she never experienced a father figure in her life. My mums relationships have been toxic to the point that she had a live in boyfriend who got her pregnant and she had a still birth but when the boyfriend discovered that my mum was pregnant he left her and she went into depression so I had to take care of her during the course of her pregnancy and I ended up now sleeping on the floor in her room and doing everything for her especially in winter her pregnancy was very demanding I'd wake up at 2am daily to make tea for her then if she wanted more blankets or socks or woolen hats I'd make sure that I'd fix everything for her but it started to take a toll on my mental health and I'd leave for school at 4am and walk alone with my thoughts and I was 16 at this time waiting to write my O level exams. I thought that after the baby was born everything was going to be fine but I wasn't even ready for the mountain that came after...my mother had a still birth at 9 months. When her boyfriend left we promised we'd take care of the baby especially me so that my mother wouldn't worry but she lost the baby and the aftermath was worse than I could ever imagine, she suffered another phase of great depression to the point where she would refuse to eat or bath and I'd do that for her and I'd still leave for school at 4am but when I'd reach school I'd start thinking about why I left home early and I should go back and be there for my mother because if she dies we have no one to take care of us. It was bad to the point that her stitches started to rot and I had to start cleaning her stitches and forcing to put medicine on them so that they heal down there and it was horrific. She would overdose medication and at one point I thought that I'd loose her but she made it. We didn't watch TV for a whole year and when we started to watch TV again we'd make sure we prewatch the movies and it would be anything without children and this happened for another year. Yes I failed my exams of course and O level results are really important especially in Africa for a person to do a meaningful course. I proceeded to go to A level and my mum  got back with the boyfriend who got her pregnant and the house was tense and it was horrible living in that environment because I had so much anger towards the man but I kept it inside and he came back with the act that he wanted to make things right and marry my mum but she fell for it and in total they dated for 7years until last year when they broke up finally I hope because she started to realize that this man wasn't going to marry her and in Africa being a single mother is shamed upon so that's why she was soooo hopeful that she'd get married and regain respect especially from her siblings. When covid happened that was the same year I was supposed to write my A level Cambridge exams but I wasn't able to the 2021 my mum came out of the blues and said that I should write my exams but I hadn't been going to school for a whole year and I wasn't doing any lessons so I ended up failing my exams again. After that whole period I've spent 4years at home I tried doing a nurse aide course so that I can go work in the UK and then study my way into becoming a nurse whilst paying for myself because I would have lessened the burden for my mum and she'd focus on my little sister so I passed with Honours and did my ielts and passed with a 7.0 band score and all these I studied on my own and did it but I failed to get a sponsor or a certificate of sponsorship to be able to work in the UK so I told my dad I needed help with talking to my grandmother to take me on her visa as she is already a UK citizen and can bring anyone as long as we use the same surname but my dad refused and instead took my whole idea and went to the UK which is where he's now living. His parents and his siblings all stay there and went when I was about 2years so if they wanted to help me they would but we don't have a close relationship so now my mum wants me to follow my passion and be a makeup artist but the fees for internationally recognized certificates are expensive and the friction we have is that all these years I've been the one telling her when the nurse aide program started I told her before a lot of countries were being red listed so that I do the course but she never saw the seriousness until her friend and children left that's when the insults came and I would start being called names and every insult and that I'm not serious with life and I'm a looser just like my father. Then I came up to her with the second idea of getting my makeup certificate and working on cruiseships but again my idea was shut down until now and then the insults started that I'm not serious with life and I'm going to end up a nobody in life just like my father and to make matters worse my little sister is starting university soon and now she thinks I'm in competition with her and that's why I am pushing for me to leave but I've honestly wanted to leave for the longest because of our living environment and people who look from the outside think we have a good life but now everything is getting worse because she's now dating a boy close to my age and she goes out almost every night after work and when she comes back home I have to make sure she's okay and if she's drunk I have to be helping her and it's been taking a toll on me and my life. My sister is happy to be leaving for university because of everything that's been happening but my mum doesn't want me to leave because even when the nurse aide thing failed she said to me maybe it's God who made you not go because he knows I need you but I'm tired I need my own life. End of 2024 I had two mild strokes and almost died and now I'm on bp medication and a bunch of other heart medication and I feel like all this has been pushed to this point because of the stresses in my life and if I try to talk to my Mum she shouts at me and makes me the bad guy to the point where now she's not talking to me. It's been 3 days of her not talking to me. I have had high blood pressure since 11 when my parents divorced but now it's getting worse and even on the meds it sometimes is still extremely high. I'm tired of everything, I have really tried but I'm tired. I just want to die. I didn't even write everything but just a small part so you guys could understand. I am tired of living, yes as a Christian I shouldn't be thinking like this but honestly I'm tired. I tried a lot of things like writing to organisations that help the less privileged so that I can get assistance in becoming a makeup artist or beauty therapist but everything has proven in vain so I'm ready to throw the towel. I'm tired of everything. ",depression,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525

I'VE GIVEN UP ON LIFE,"ATP I feel like I'm cursed and my life is destined for disaster...I'm a f22 staying in an environment that is very toxic to the point my own mother isn't talking to me. My parents divorced when I was 11years old because my father was an abusive man and I had to convince my mother to leave otherwise she would have been dead. My mother has been the only parent in my life helping me and my sister with everything whilst on the other hand my dad has literally been a dead beat who continued on with his abusive nature and married twice the first after my mother didn't work out because he was extremely abusive and beat up the wife to the point where she lost her baby and the second wife he started seeing her during his marriage to the other wife and got her pregnant and now she has 3 kids by him but he relocated to go to the UK which was my idea first during the time when they used to take a lot of people from different African countries to be healthcare assistants in the UK but he discouraged me not to go because apparently life in the UK is not easy but he ended up going using all my ideas and how I wanted to relocate and he's been going between his wife with 3 kids and his new girlfriend in the UK. He barely visited us when he was still staying in the same country as us but he affords to catch flights and visit 2year old twins who will barely remember him from the 3rd wife...so life after my parents divorce was tough and it pushed me to grow up quickly and if there are any Africans here they understand what I'm talking about. I had to be the mother my little sister didn't have and literally everything our household needed (the mechanic for our car, the maid, the gardener, the fast thinker) my mother was going through great depression at the time and I had to make sure that we pulled through and I did as she didn't want to talk to anyone and she'd stay in her room for hours sometimes putting the TV on and just staring at it even until the movie finishes without even processing or watching the movie but she eventually got out of it. Over the years that role has stuck with me being the literal parent to both my mother and sister but now I'm tired infact I've been tired a long time ago because I never experienced being a child and it took a toll on me to the point that I've tried committing suicide 8 times since I was 14. From 14 my mums mood swings started and all the rage and anger she felt for my father and even any situation she'd take it out on me and my sister always got the better end of the bargain because my mum would always baby her saying she needs most of the love as she was just 6 or 7 years when my parents divorced so she never experienced a father figure in her life. My mums relationships have been toxic to the point that she had a live in boyfriend who got her pregnant and she had a still birth but when the boyfriend discovered that my mum was pregnant he left her and she went into depression so I had to take care of her during the course of her pregnancy and I ended up now sleeping on the floor in her room and doing everything for her especially in winter her pregnancy was very demanding I'd wake up at 2am daily to make tea for her then if she wanted more blankets or socks or woolen hats I'd make sure that I'd fix everything for her but it started to take a toll on my mental health and I'd leave for school at 4am and walk alone with my thoughts and I was 16 at this time waiting to write my O level exams. I thought that after the baby was born everything was going to be fine but I wasn't even ready for the mountain that came after...my mother had a still birth at 9 months. When her boyfriend left we promised we'd take care of the baby especially me so that my mother wouldn't worry but she lost the baby and the aftermath was worse than I could ever imagine, she suffered another phase of great depression to the point where she would refuse to eat or bath and I'd do that for her and I'd still leave for school at 4am but when I'd reach school I'd start thinking about why I left home early and I should go back and be there for my mother because if she dies we have no one to take care of us. It was bad to the point that her stitches started to rot and I had to start cleaning her stitches and forcing to put medicine on them so that they heal down there and it was horrific. She would overdose medication and at one point I thought that I'd loose her but she made it. We didn't watch TV for a whole year and when we started to watch TV again we'd make sure we prewatch the movies and it would be anything without children and this happened for another year. Yes I failed my exams of course and O level results are really important especially in Africa for a person to do a meaningful course. I proceeded to go to A level and my mum  got back with the boyfriend who got her pregnant and the house was tense and it was horrible living in that environment because I had so much anger towards the man but I kept it inside and he came back with the act that he wanted to make things right and marry my mum but she fell for it and in total they dated for 7years until last year when they broke up finally I hope because she started to realize that this man wasn't going to marry her and in Africa being a single mother is shamed upon so that's why she was soooo hopeful that she'd get married and regain respect especially from her siblings. When covid happened that was the same year I was supposed to write my A level Cambridge exams but I wasn't able to the 2021 my mum came out of the blues and said that I should write my exams but I hadn't been going to school for a whole year and I wasn't doing any lessons so I ended up failing my exams again.

I thought that after the baby was born everything was going to be fine but I wasn't even ready for the mountain that came after...my mother had a still birth at 9 months. When her boyfriend left we promised we'd take care of the baby especially me so that my mother wouldn't worry but she lost the baby and the aftermath was worse than I could ever imagine, she suffered another phase of great depression to the point where she would refuse to eat or bath and I'd do that for her and I'd still leave for school at 4am but when I'd reach school I'd start thinking about why I left home early and I should go back and be there for my mother because if she dies we have no one to take care of us. It was bad to the point that her stitches started to rot and I had to start cleaning her stitches and forcing to put medicine on them so that they heal down there and it was horrific. She would overdose medication and at one point I thought that I'd loose her but she made it. We didn't watch TV for a whole year and when we started to watch TV again we'd make sure we prewatch the movies and it would be anything without children and this happened for another year. Yes I failed my exams of course and O level results are really important especially in Africa for a person to do a meaningful course. I proceeded to go to A level and my mum  got back with the boyfriend who got her pregnant and the house was tense and it was horrible living in that environment because I had so much anger towards the man but I kept it inside and he came back with the act that he wanted to make things right and marry my mum but she fell for it and in total they dated for 7years until last year when they broke up finally I hope because she started to realize that this man wasn't going to marry her and in Africa being a single mother is shamed upon so that's why she was soooo hopeful that she'd get married and regain respect especially from her siblings. When covid happened that was the same year I was supposed to write my A level Cambridge exams but I wasn't able to the 2021 my mum came out of the blues and said that I should write my exams but I hadn't been going to school for a whole year and I wasn't doing any lessons so I ended up failing my exams again. After that whole period I've spent 4years at home I tried doing a nurse aide course so that I can go work in the UK and then study my way into becoming a nurse whilst paying for myself because I would have lessened the burden for my mum and she'd focus on my little sister so I passed with Honours and did my ielts and passed with a 7.0 band score and all these I studied on my own and did it but I failed to get a sponsor or a certificate of sponsorship to be able to work in the UK so I told my dad I needed help with talking to my grandmother to take me on her visa as she is already a UK citizen and can bring anyone as long as we use the same surname but my dad refused and instead took my whole idea and went to the UK which is where he's now living. His parents and his siblings all stay there and went when I was about 2years so if they wanted to help me they would but we don't have a close relationship so now my mum wants me to follow my passion and be a makeup artist but the fees for internationally recognized certificates are expensive and the friction we have is that all these years I've been the one telling her when the nurse aide program started I told her before a lot of countries were being red listed so that I do the course but she never saw the seriousness until her friend and children left that's when the insults came and I would start being called names and every insult and that I'm not serious with life and I'm a looser just like my father. Then I came up to her with the second idea of getting my makeup certificate and working on cruiseships but again my idea was shut down until now and then the insults started that I'm not serious with life and I'm going to end up a nobody in life just like my father and to make matters worse my little sister is starting university soon and now she thinks I'm in competition with her and that's why I am pushing for me to leave but I've honestly wanted to leave for the longest because of our living environment and people who look from the outside think we have a good life but now everything is getting worse because she's now dating a boy close to my age and she goes out almost every night after work and when she comes back home I have to make sure she's okay and if she's drunk I have to be helping her and it's been taking a toll on me and my life. My sister is happy to be leaving for university because of everything that's been happening but my mum doesn't want me to leave because even when the nurse aide thing failed she said to me maybe it's God who made you not go because he knows I need you but I'm tired I need my own life. End of 2024 I had two mild strokes and almost died and now I'm on bp medication and a bunch of other heart medication and I feel like all this has been pushed to this point because of the stresses in my life and if I try to talk to my Mum she shouts at me and makes me the bad guy to the point where now she's not talking to me. It's been 3 days of her not talking to me. I have had high blood pressure since 11 when my parents divorced but now it's getting worse and even on the meds it sometimes is still extremely high. I'm tired of everything, I have really tried but I'm tired. I just want to die. I didn't even write everything but just a small part so you guys could understand. I am tired of living, yes as a Christian I shouldn't be thinking like this but honestly I'm tired. I tried a lot of things like writing to organisations that help the less privileged so that I can get assistance in becoming a makeup artist or beauty therapist but everything has proven in vain so I'm ready to throw the towel. I'm tired of everything. ",depression,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525
Been in my room for 3 days,"I don’t talk to anyone at all about how I feel anymore. Tired of the same bullshit and questions. People act like fucking idiots who never have read a goddamn book or put a fucking context clue together.
Anyway I’m fed the fuck up and can’t do anything but scroll on my phone and stay in bed. My meds aren’t doing a fucking thing anymore, I thought they worked. Been taking them for over a year. Thought for the first time in 10 years I found the right pills.

Depression feels like it never ends,"I've been depressed since I was 11. I'm 23 now. I've been medicated for the last 3/4 years, and it's been awesome. I love meds. But regardless, I feel like depression never fully goes away. I feel like I'm always just getting through life, and recently I feel like I did before I got medicated. My life is just so shit that no meds can fix how bad it is. I can't clean my apartment. I'm a grad student and work 60+ hours a week, and come home exhausted. I haven't done any of my hobbies is ages. I can't feed myself, I can't do my laundry, I hate my apartment, I hate my clothes. Everyone at work is pushing me harder and harder and I have nothing left to give. I'm exhausted. I can't keep doing this. I cry every single day, and I just drag myself around constantly. I don't want to die but I want to disappear, to just vanish and live my life in some shadows doing whatever I want undisturbed. I know the depression never fully goes away, but I need it to be kept at bay.  ",depression,,bay.  ,30.2481693,-85.6593633

Becky lives with her mother's cousin (her guardian) since her mother died when Becky was 9 and she's been through alot and is very mature due to that. She gets along with older people like me and her sister(32) more than kids her own age.

Within the last 6-8 months she has befriended Joe because he also had severe depression as a child so he ""gets her"", I'm not okay with any of this. They go on day snowboarding trips alone, he's taken her driving and she sat on his lap(because ""she's short""???). They even have plans to see a movie tomorrow night together. Becky is gay and thinks everything is 100% platonic and that Joe is like an older brother. She says nothing has ever happened and she would throw a fit and scream if he ever tried anything and I 100% believe that but it's him I am worried about.

Last night I found out that when he comes over to see our family friend he says hi to Becky and checks in with her and they usually talk (with the door open). Last night he left at 5am because he ""fell asleep in Becky's room.

Again, Becky doesnt see anything wrong and I believe nothing (besides sitting on his lap driving) has happened but that doesn't mean nothing WILL happen! Advice?

I hate my life,"I’m 54. 
Looking back over the past years my life has been a domino of disasters each becoming a stronger tornado ripping my world apart leaving me with less and less to start over. 

Here’s my life in an outline:
1. First memory of my mom: “I hate you . I wish you has never been born”
2. I’m a straight A student with so much potential and love for life
3. My narcissistic abusive mother beat me down and destroyed my self esteem. 
4. I graduate with honors and major in biological engineering 
5. Stupidity I changed to architecture. This career has been a disaster. Low salaries. Multiple layoffs from 911, the bubble burst, and COVID. 
6. In college I got pregnant in my 3rd year of architecture school by my boyfriend of 3 years I was deeply in love with. 
7. When we found out I was pregnant he said “don’t expect me to marry you .”
8. He was cheating on me and I found out he had started using cocaine. 
9. I’m a single mom with no support trying to finish college ALONE!
10. After graduation a guy that was my best friend and had been since we started college together wanted us to make a go for a relationship. 
11. It was wonderful
12. He wanted me and my daughter to move to the city he had moved to so we could take our relationship to the next level: marriage. 
13. He wasn’t just a boyfriend. He was my best friend. 
14. I move. We get married in December.
15. February the following year he says “this marriage isn’t what I thought it was going to be. I want a divorce.”
16. March: me and my daughter come home to an empty house. He moved out. Wouldn’t talk to me or answer the phone. 
17. I’m served divorce papers at my new job where everyone knew I moved there to marry him. 
18. 2 years go by and he realizes it was a mistake and wants to marry again. 
19. We do. And vowed never to say the “d” word.
20. We had almost 10 great years. Best decade of my life. We went hiking, camping, kayaking, star gazing, and many more wonderful times. 
21. 8 years later he becomes full of anger and rage. The D word comes back. He would get in my face and yell at me calling me a liar… 
22. Second divorce 
23. Time goes by and I meet a guy. We hit it off. Dated. Got married. We had a baby. After the baby was born the abuse began. It was violent. He threatened to kill me if I left him. I had to get an order of protection. I divorced him. His family is extremely wealthy. He said “I’m going to make sure you are financially devastated and loose your job.” My current employer was friends of his parents. 
24. Divorce cost over $25,000 
25. 4 months after our divorce was final I was fired. 
26. I take a job in my hometown. 
27. My mom tells me she wants to help me get on my feet and I can move into her home. It was empty. She was going to sell it. She married a great guy who had a home in the country. Instead of selling I could live there, pay the mortgage, when I was financially ready buy the house from her. 
28. When I  start to move in she tells me “I’m moving back in my house. I took a job nearby and do not want to drive from the country. You and your daughter can take one of the bedrooms. 
29. What am I going to do with my stuff?
30. It was decided that My now grown first daughter would move into my home and I would leave my things there. 
31. My mom sells the house and gives me less than 2 weeks notice to find a place to live. 
32. I want to move back into my home where all my things are. 
33. That created a huge family riff. 
34. I conceded and moved into a mold infested dump. I  had no furniture and had to once again start over. 
35. I was evicted because I found black mold in the apartment and brought it to my landlords attention. 
36. I had to scramble and find a place to live. A studio apartment. 
37. I move from there to a 2 bedroom. 
38. My grown daughter needs help- she’s a single mom, I get a townhouse for us to live together in to help her. 
39. She trashed it. Wouldn’t pay rent or help with the bills. When the lease was up my rent went up $400/month. I had to find a new place to live and it wasn’t working with my daughter. 
40. I move into a nice rental house
41. I loose my job from COVID
42. I find a remote job luckily. 
43. Finally feeling like I’m crawling out of the dark hole. 
44. My ex starts a custody battle to take custody away from my daughter. 
45. $25,000 again in legal fees. 
46. Reunited with a friend from architecture school I had known for 30 years. 
47. We date for 2 years. Decide to take the next step in our relationship. We  move to his location - I take my remote job with me. 
48. We marry
49. It’s been a mental battle of depression and anxiety 
50. He tells me frequently “this isn’t going to work. We need to figure something out and go our separate ways. 
51. The house is in his name. He bought it before we were married. 
52. Leaving again: I have nothing to start over with. 
53. I started a new job that increased my salary by 65%. I hate it. It’s extremely stressful with intense deadlines.

So from 49 to 53 is where I am now. 

I’m done. This life has SUCKED! 

I have nothing. No retirement. I live with an emotionally abusive husband. I’m on eggshells every day. His sons act like shits to me and my daughter now 13. 

54. 
That’s my life’s legacy.

Edit:
I forgot to add that in 2016 I was diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia. 

The most painful nerve disorder there is. It causes excruciating facial pain that can be triggered by a breeze on your face, brushing your teeth, washing your face, talking , eating, anything that touches any part of your face that nerve touches. I’m on several meds to keep it under control. For the most part it’s livable with medication but it’s always there. 

From the web:
Trigeminal neuralgia (try-JEM-ih-nul nu-RAL-juh) is a condition that causes intense pain similar to an electric shock on one side of the face. It affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries signals from the face to the brain. Even light touch from brushing your teeth or putting on makeup may trigger a jolt of pain. Trigeminal neuralgia can be long-lasting. It's known as a chronic pain condition.

It's called the ""Suicide Disease"" because it causes unbearable pain in the face and temples. It's often triggered by everyday things like brushing teeth, shaving, or putting on makeup. In many cases, the culprit is an out-of-place blood vessel that.

Yeah. 

Add that in to all of the above.

"it will be long, I'm sorry","hi, so...there's a situation. before I'll start - english is not my first language, so sorry if my sentences sounds weird or aren't correct grammatically. 

so. for many years now i think that I'm depressed, but there are things that make me feel like I'm imagining things or something, i don't even know. because i feel things that depressed people feel - i have no strength to do basic things, i struggle to even brush my teeth and i need to prepare myself for taking a stupid shower. i just don't have strength and motivation to do anything. i have huge problems with my sleep and i can't eat normally. not because I'm trying to starve myself, i just literally don't have strength for eating and sometimes i even forget about it until I suddenly feel weak. and if i actually want to eat something, i have problems to pick anything because i have no appetite, so at the end i still eat little, but i guess that it doesn't matter since i don't want to actually starve myself and when I'm REALLY hungry then i can force myself to eat even stupid cereals. 

my condition in general is terrible and I'm tired by everything I'm doing, even 8 hours in work is twice harder than it should be. and when I'm finishing something that basic like cleaning the house, then I'm very proud of myself and i feel like i just did a great work. I'm also very often thinking about basic depression things like 'is there a point?' or 'I am useless and pathetic, why I am even here if i am a failure in everything?' and other things like that. I also have a lot of emotional rollercoasters and I can start crying suddenly without any reason at all, and when I have the reason then I can't control my emotions and I'm starting crying even in public and humiliating myself in the process (I'm an adult, so I should control my emotions in public, that's so embarrassing). I also have a lot of issues about my self-worth and one day I think that maybe I'm not that bad when i managed to do something good and I even look nice, but then next day I think that I'm absolutely worthless, useless and ugly. 

I didn't mention a lot of things, but in general - I'm a wreck, yeah. but the point of this post if not to whine and complaining, and I'm sorry if I did it unintentionally, I'm just trying to explain everything the best i can. the point is, that I don't have one huge part of depression - I am not suicidal. actually quite opposite, I have a really big and serious phobia of death, I can have a panic attack even just because I started to think that one day I will die and disappear, that everything will not just go dark and I'll wake up later, but that I will literally disappear and I won't even be able to hear my thoughts or have another life, that I will just stop existing. even while writing these few stupid words I have tears in my eyes and I started breathing heavier. and I also appreciate a lot of things in life, and while I hate a lot of dumb and awful people and how cruel this word is, I see and love a lot of things that good humans made or beautiful things that nature made. and I am literally paranoid about everything that can take my life. and everything can take our life, so my life is a one big paranoia, a lot of small phobias is connected to this one big phobia. I'm afraid of a LOT of things and everything is stressing me, and even making me think about stupid scenarios like ""what if i would just have a car crash?"" or ""what if someone would just want to kidnap me or hurt me?""

I'm trying to function in a society since I have to, but I'm stressed about everything, even basic things like driving a car or walking alone by the street (I'm a woman so i actually have reasons to be afraid of walking alone, so it doesn't help my paranoia). of course, I'm doing all of this, I'm not sitting all days locked in my room just because life stressing me out and is exhausting. I'm trying to live, I'm trying really hard and I'm constantly crossing my comfort zone, almost everyday. even if everything is a huge effort for me, like every single thing, I'm still fighting everyday to just live and not ruin my life more than it's ruined already. 

and I'm really confused is what I have is depression or if I'm just pathetic or something, I don't know how to even describe that, i don't know how to think about myself. I had a therapy once, I was...surprise, who would have thought...scared, to go to a therapy since it could take my money without a reason (if that wouldn't help) and on top of that, my father was mocking me about even needing therapy. but I tried, so I had a therapy for a whole year. and yes, it didn't help. I think that maybe I found a not really good therapist, but I tried to trust her since she was all the time really nice and seemed like she wanted to help. but when I talked to her about my depression, she said that I can't have depression since I told her before about many things I appreciate in life, that I'm determined to live and that I'm full of excitement about my passions, and that she don't see it in me. I thought that - well, okay, she's a specialist in her job, I am not, so maybe i am just utterly pathetic and that there's no help for me. I literally don't know what's wrong with me. 

I recently started to think that I also probably have adhd on top of all that, since from what I read in the internet (not just few articles, i read a lot about that, mostly about real experiences from people that actually have diagnosed adhd) everything seems to suits me, and everything i read abouts experiences of people with adhd i think ""oh, yeah, that's me!"" and ""oh, that explains a lot, yeah, that's also me!"". unfortunately when i was during therapy i didn't suspended adhd yet i didn't tried to be diagnosed with it. yet. i was more focused on what's wrong with me and i wanted to have anything that would make me feel like i know what's going on. but eh, all months of therapy was almost useless. like yeah, it was nice to talk about my problems with someone who can tell me more than ""I'm sorry to hear that"", but it didn't actually helped me in anything. and i didn't even received any diagnoses, which was the main thing i wanted when i came there. i resigned after a year and now i don't have any therapy even if I'm aware that I should. i don't have great work and I'm not rich, i prefer to spend every salary on more important things like food, tickets on train since i don't have my job in the same city i live in, and all other basic needs or things that makes me happy and I'm passionate about, since it helps me to have at least a bit of joy when i feel like sh*t (idk if i can swear here so I'll censor). i just can't afford a therapy, and yeah, i know, maybe if i would try harder, started putting aside part of my salary, stopped buying some less important things like these about my passions...then probably I could afford a therapy. but. I'm reluctant to even try, since it didn't work last time, and happened exactly what i was scared about - i spend my money without a reason, I didn't felt like anything changed and even after a year I felt like everything is the same and that wasting my money on that was pointless.

and honestly i don't think that it will have sense even in the future. like, I know that I'm struggling and my life is sh*t, that I'm a failure and all that, but there's no point. I don't think that my phobia of death will be healed, even if I would try. that's something that just won't go away and it will be with me until my last moment, because that's something that I won't escape. there's a lot of phobias, like darkness or bugs, and healing them is possible, because that's something we can work on. but death? how I can work on that? I can't. that's something that will happen and this paranoia about that will be with me always. I know that the only one thing I can do about that is accept it, and embrace something that is just as natural as being born. but the point of this phobia is that I literally can't. maybe in the future? I still hope that my life will be better someday, and I hope that if it will happen, then my phobia will be less destructive. since maybe I finally will be happy one day, and in that case, maybe my phobia even if still being there, will be just a part of me that will make me helpless and scared sometimes, but not causing panic attacks. but for now, it's strong and a bit ruining my life. I mean, there's a lot of things that's ruining my life. but I just have the impression that this one phobia is a main thing and every other phobias are just a result of this one phobia. 

and besides any phobias, if I have adhd and depression, that's another things that's making my life a lot harder than it's already and if i really have adhd then that's also a thing that was making my life harder since i was a kid. because yes, I was struggling even as a little dumb kid, always being hyperactive, having problems with concentration, and struggling for every one year of my whole education since I always had a lot of problems with learning and I needed to try harder than other kids to understand basic things in school. and I always needed more creative and stimulating ways to understand things better and to be actually interested in them. and I won't even talk about how terrible is my memory and how much I was upset at myself that I just can't remember things and that I need to spend so much time on learning stuff, and that even if I actually knew something, it often just disappeared from my mind in the moment I looked at the test. just great that no one suspended that maybe I have adhd and that no one decided to make my life easier and check if maybe I'm not just stupid. because like...I think a lot of awful things about myself, and maybe NOW I am stupid, but I clearly remember that as a kid I was reading a lot of books and when I was actually passionate about some subjects and when I was learning things in a more creative and stimulating ways, then I was able to learn a lot of interesting things and actually remember them. I remember how passionate I was as a little kid about cosmos, planets, stars and stuff like that. I was reading a lot of science books about that and even my parents was buying me science books about cosmos and stars on my birthdays apart of some dolls. but well, then somehow I went to school and barely passed a math test after learing a whole week for this sh*t. what a stupid kid, hmm, interesting if maybe something is wrong. nah, probably just stupid kid.

ANYWAY.

the point of this post was just to explain my situation and ask you guys if you think that I have depression since I'm not suicidal. but typically, I went off topic probably about 100 times throughout this entire post and started complaining about my life or telling things no one asked to read about, when I tried to write as neutral as I can and just give you information to get your opinion. so...sorry about that!

"it will be long, I'm sorry","hi, so...there's a situation. before I'll start - english is not my first language, so sorry if my sentences sounds weird or aren't correct grammatically. 

so. for many years now i think that I'm depressed, but there are things that make me feel like I'm imagining things or something, i don't even know. because i feel things that depressed people feel - i have no strength to do basic things, i struggle to even brush my teeth and i need to prepare myself for taking a stupid shower. i just don't have strength and motivation to do anything. i have huge problems with my sleep and i can't eat normally. not because I'm trying to starve myself, i just literally don't have strength for eating and sometimes i even forget about it until I suddenly feel weak. and if i actually want to eat something, i have problems to pick anything because i have no appetite, so at the end i still eat little, but i guess that it doesn't matter since i don't want to actually starve myself and when I'm REALLY hungry then i can force myself to eat even stupid cereals. 

my condition in general is terrible and I'm tired by everything I'm doing, even 8 hours in work is twice harder than it should be. and when I'm finishing something that basic like cleaning the house, then I'm very proud of myself and i feel like i just did a great work. I'm also very often thinking about basic depression things like 'is there a point?' or 'I am useless and pathetic, why I am even here if i am a failure in everything?' and other things like that. I also have a lot of emotional rollercoasters and I can start crying suddenly without any reason at all, and when I have the reason then I can't control my emotions and I'm starting crying even in public and humiliating myself in the process (I'm an adult, so I should control my emotions in public, that's so embarrassing).

I didn't mention a lot of things, but in general - I'm a wreck, yeah. but the point of this post if not to whine and complaining, and I'm sorry if I did it unintentionally, I'm just trying to explain everything the best i can. the point is, that I don't have one huge part of depression - I am not suicidal. actually quite opposite, I have a really big and serious phobia of death, I can have a panic attack even just because I started to think that one day I will die and disappear, that everything will not just go dark and I'll wake up later, but that I will literally disappear and I won't even be able to hear my thoughts or have another life, that I will just stop existing. even while writing these few stupid words I have tears in my eyes and I started breathing heavier. and I also appreciate a lot of things in life, and while I hate a lot of dumb and awful people and how cruel this word is, I see and love a lot of things that good humans made or beautiful things that nature made. and I am literally paranoid about everything that can take my life. and everything can take our life, so my life is a one big paranoia, a lot of small phobias is connected to this one big phobia. I'm afraid of a LOT of things and everything is stressing me, and even making me think about stupid scenarios like ""what if i would just have a car crash?"" or ""what if someone would just want to kidnap me or hurt me?""

I'm trying to function in a society since I have to, but I'm stressed about everything, even basic things like driving a car or walking alone by the street (I'm a woman so i actually have reasons to be afraid of walking alone, so it doesn't help my paranoia). of course, I'm doing all of this, I'm not sitting all days locked in my room just because life stressing me out and is exhausting. I'm trying to live, I'm trying really hard and I'm constantly crossing my comfort zone, almost everyday. even if everything is a huge effort for me, like every single thing, I'm still fighting everyday to just live and not ruin my life more than it's ruined already. 

and I'm really confused is what I have is depression or if I'm just pathetic or something, I don't know how to even describe that, i don't know how to think about myself. I had a therapy once, I was...surprise, who would have thought...scared, to go to a therapy since it could take my money without a reason (if that wouldn't help) and on top of that, my father was mocking me about even needing therapy. but I tried, so I had a therapy for a whole year. and yes, it didn't help. I think that maybe I found a not really good therapist, but I tried to trust her since she was all the time really nice and seemed like she wanted to help. but when I talked to her about my depression, she said that I can't have depression since I told her before about many things I appreciate in life, that I'm determined to live and that I'm full of excitement about my passions, and that she don't see it in me. I thought that - well, okay, she's a specialist in her job, I am not, so maybe i am just utterly pathetic and that there's no help for me. I literally don't know what's wrong with me. 

I recently started to think that I also probably have adhd on top of all that, since from what I read in the internet (not just few articles, i read a lot about that, mostly about real experiences from people that actually have diagnosed adhd) everything seems to suits me, and everything i read abouts experiences of people with adhd i think ""oh, yeah, that's me!"" and ""oh, that explains a lot, yeah, that's also me!"". unfortunately when i was during therapy i didn't suspended adhd yet i didn't tried to be diagnosed with it. yet. i was more focused on what's wrong with me and i wanted to have anything that would make me feel like i know what's going on. but eh, all months of therapy was almost useless. like yeah, it was nice to talk about my problems with someone who can tell me more than ""I'm sorry to hear that"", but it didn't actually helped me in anything. and i didn't even received any diagnoses, which was the main thing i wanted when i came there. i resigned after a year and now i don't have any therapy even if I'm aware that I should. i don't have great work and I'm not rich, i prefer to spend every salary on more important things like food, tickets on train since i don't have my job in the same city i live in, and all other basic needs or things that makes me happy and I'm passionate about, since it helps me to have at least a bit of joy when i feel like sh*t (idk if i can swear here so I'll censor). i just can't afford a therapy, and yeah, i know, maybe if i would try harder, started putting aside part of my salary, stopped buying some less important things like these about my passions...then probably I could afford a therapy. but. I'm reluctant to even try, since it didn't work last time, and happened exactly what i was scared about - i spend my money without a reason, I didn't felt like anything changed and even after a year I felt like everything is the same and that wasting my money on that was pointless.

and honestly i don't think that it will have sense even in the future. like, I know that I'm struggling and my life is sh*t, that I'm a failure and all that, but there's no point. I don't think that my phobia of death will be healed, even if I would try. that's something that just won't go away and it will be with me until my last moment, because that's something that I won't escape. there's a lot of phobias, like darkness or bugs, and healing them is possible, because that's something we can work on. but death? how I can work on that? I can't. that's something that will happen and this paranoia about that will be with me always. I know that the only one thing I can do about that is accept it, and embrace something that is just as natural as being born. but the point of this phobia is that I literally can't. maybe in the future? I still hope that my life will be better someday, and I hope that if it will happen, then my phobia will be less destructive. since maybe I finally will be happy one day, and in that case, maybe my phobia even if still being there, will be just a part of me that will make me helpless and scared sometimes, but not causing panic attacks. but for now, it's strong and a bit ruining my life. I mean, there's a lot of things that's ruining my life. but I just have the impression that this one phobia is a main thing and every other phobias are just a result of this one phobia. 

and besides any phobias, if I have adhd and depression, that's another things that's making my life a lot harder than it's already and if i really have adhd then that's also a thing that was making my life harder since i was a kid. because yes, I was struggling even as a little dumb kid, always being hyperactive, having problems with concentration, and struggling for every one year of my whole education since I always had a lot of problems with learning and I needed to try harder than other kids to understand basic things in school. and I always needed more creative and stimulating ways to understand things better and to be actually interested in them. and I won't even talk about how terrible is my memory and how much I was upset at myself that I just can't remember things and that I need to spend so much time on learning stuff, and that even if I actually knew something, it often just disappeared from my mind in the moment I looked at the test. just great that no one suspended that maybe I have adhd and that no one decided to make my life easier and check if maybe I'm not just stupid. because like...I think a lot of awful things about myself, and maybe NOW I am stupid, but I clearly remember that as a kid I was reading a lot of books and when I was actually passionate about some subjects and when I was learning things in a more creative and stimulating ways, then I was able to learn a lot of interesting things and actually remember them. I remember how passionate I was as a little kid about cosmos, planets, stars and stuff like that. I was reading a lot of science books about that and even my parents was buying me science books about cosmos and stars on my birthdays apart of some dolls. but well, then somehow I went to school and barely passed a math test after learing a whole week for this sh*t. what a stupid kid, hmm, interesting if maybe something is wrong. nah, probably just stupid kid.

ANYWAY.

the point of this post was just to explain my situation and ask you guys if you think that I have depression since I'm not suicidal. but typically, I went off topic probably about 100 times throughout this entire post and started complaining about my life or telling things no one asked to read about, when I tried to write as neutral as I can and just give you information to get your opinion. so...sorry about that!

"it will be long, I'm sorry","hi, so...there's a situation. before I'll start - english is not my first language, so sorry if my sentences sounds weird or aren't correct grammatically. 

so. for many years now i think that I'm depressed, but there are things that make me feel like I'm imagining things or something, i don't even know. because i feel things that depressed people feel - i have no strength to do basic things, i struggle to even brush my teeth and i need to prepare myself for taking a stupid shower. i just don't have strength and motivation to do anything. i have huge problems with my sleep and i can't eat normally. not because I'm trying to starve myself, i just literally don't have strength for eating and sometimes i even forget about it until I suddenly feel weak. and if i actually want to eat something, i have problems to pick anything because i have no appetite, so at the end i still eat little, but i guess that it doesn't matter since i don't want to actually starve myself and when I'm REALLY hungry then i can force myself to eat even stupid cereals. 

my condition in general is terrible and I'm tired by everything I'm doing, even 8 hours in work is twice harder than it should be. and when I'm finishing something that basic like cleaning the house, then I'm very proud of myself and i feel like i just did a great work. I'm also very often thinking about basic depression things like 'is there a point?' or 'I am useless and pathetic, why I am even here if i am a failure in everything?' and other things like that. I also have a lot of emotional rollercoasters and I can start crying suddenly without any reason at all, and when I have the reason then I can't control my emotions and I'm starting crying even in public and humiliating myself in the process (I'm an adult, so I should control my emotions in public, that's so embarrassing).

I feel like a bum and a loser despite everyone around me thinking I'm a super human. PLEASE HELP!,"**FYI this is my first every reddit post so it might not be well written. the question is at the end so feel free to skip or skim read the context as it will likely be useless**

**for some context on me and my life:** 

I am 19yo, 6'3, muscular skinny build, male

I am incredibly fortunate in every single way. I am gifted with academics getting straight A\*s in high school and going to a very prestigious university to study electronics and electrical engineering(something I am passionate about), 

\- I work as a model for big brands walking runway shows in London and Paris fashion week, 

\- two weeks ago I competed in a world championships for my country.

\- I've completed a lot of side quests including: running a marathon bare foot for charity, building   hydroponics and other robotics, winning county chess tournaments and the list goes on

***these last two I'm by no means proud of or would ever brag about but are worth referencing.***

\- I am  born into a very wealthy family with a very well known and respected name.

I feel miserable,"I am a 30 years old man soon to turn 31 and am supposed to graduate from my second master’s in the end of April. I studied psychology and reorientated myself to biostatistics. I only have one class left but I am probably going to fail it. 

I have diagnosed depression since this summer and ADD. 

I feel like a failure. I live at my parents, can’t find a job in my field or at minimum salary and am failing at school. This morning, I asked for social welfare (which is last resort financial help in Canada). Even if I had relationships in the past, they also all failed and I can’t get into a new one, at least not in my current situation. I feel like I’m doomed to be a loser. My friends are all in relationships, have their own place, are well into their careers and are overall successful. I feel like I’m the loser of my group, or am simply a loser in general and I don’t see how this could change in the future. I feel like I am a dumbass, and that I am hopeless. 

I don’t see how I could get my life back on track as no matter how hard I try, I can’t find a job and I don’t understand the material from my final class. I tried applying for hundreds of jobs, and I tried asking my professor for some advice on how to succeed my class and that doesn’t work. 

I feel stuck in my depression, I can’t seem to find pleasure in anything. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like there is nothing I can do.",depression,,Canada,61.0666922,-107.991707
My trying doesn't feel like enough,"I've felt inferior to my peers my entire life, never been good at anything at all, shit in school and in personal life.

I've always had depression, probably genetic to some degree as my mom has pretty bad depression as well as sister, and most my cousins + whole family is fucky mentally.

It makes things feel very very hard for me. I want to do things though, I really do. The most consistent thing I've ever done is now, I've studied Japanese everyday for 2 months but, it feels so meaningless. I use Anki everyday (flashcard vocab) but, can rarely ever bring myself to do anything else like practice grammar (did maybe for 2 hours total over the span of the 2 months), I've watched 1 thing so far fully in Japanese and don't feel like doing more since I just feel very apathetic, but I want too, I had so much fun just recognizing words. (tried to learn Spanish before and have the same just joy understanding things, I like languages a lot as an example of a passion that I'm just too apathetic to pursue)  


With that some days I only did 10 minutes, usually 30 minutes but, it still like I said doesn't feel like I do enough. Not even within learning a language, I studied math for 1 hour 1 day, and thought ""finally gonna get my shit together and use my time properly"" and never studied again besides maybe once or twice for 15 minutes each.

There's also just so many other things I muster up the energy to do for 1 or 2 days then I fall off.

The simplest things that are just consuming content as well are hard for me, I wanted to watch 365 movies this year, I did a fuck ton the first month and am at 90 as of today, which sounds good until it's noted that for March I watched I think 5 and February 8, so went really hard into watching 2 or more a day then crashed out for no real reason, wasn't ""burn out"" either, I just couldn't bring myself to do anything and felt like sleeping and it's been like that 2 months now.

I always just have to wait it out but the ""good"" stages of my mental health only last say a month then I have 3 or more of just straight misery where I feel hopeless, and sometimes (most the time) I don't even get a month of ""good"" I get 1 day, or if I'm lucky a week.

Now, what do I do all day if I can't bring myself to do things I actually enjoy like playing video games, watching movies, or reading? Well I don't know. My days just melt together, usually I watch Youtube but, I don't really like it if that makes sense, I don't know why it's ""easier"" for me to watch that then say something like a movie I'd enjoy but it is and it makes me feel bad since I want to do things I actually enjoy.

I just feel very tired most the time and it will never not upset me that out of 16 awake hours (if that) I can maybe do 1 hour of something productive/enjoyable and it will never not upset me that most of the time even an hour is generous and it's more like 10 minutes, if that.",depression,,Anki,24.4690842,75.888834
"Poor, I need handholding for every adult thing and self-image","I’m on disability right now but since my boyfriend is in the picture I have to provide a laundry list of shit to send to the provincial government or else they won’t send me my income, we are so close to eviction already.

My trial runs on italki havent been the best.

I feel like the teachers are actively encouraging me to use something other than italki. Not directly but you can feel it. Idk why

Maybe they’re supposed to recommend other resources?

I just want someone to talk to in these languages and talk ABOUT these languages and learn more and be fluent one day. But I felt like they were trying to get rid of me.

I don’t feel very cute and beautiful anymore. I really wanna feminise myself so that I can pass as a girl. Not all the time but I just want the option.

I’m nervous about consulting a doctor about it because I’m not trans, this is pretty much vanity I guess? I’m also a little scare that taking hormones will kill my libido and I don’t really want plastic surgery. I wanna look natural. 

Maybe it’s not meant to be and I should just accept it. Some friends have suggested going into porn and like… no. My dick doesn’t do anything right. I’m useless.

Taxes? Receipts? No one taught me this shit! Whatever rebates cash back thingies i do need desperately. I don’t wanna get dinged for fucking it up. My boyfriend helps me but, when he’s gone….. I’ll be all alone. Everyone who helped me will be gone. No younger man will help me. I have to act my own age. But I can’t because of my learning disability. There’s no way the social healthcare budget can get me a carer unless I’m in a home. I don’t even know how “rewards points” work at restaurants or stores. It’s absolute gibberish to me.

I don’t have my own car, my friends can’t come to me because they work and live far. I want nothing to do with my family.

I don’t want people doing my adult things _for_ me! But I want to learn how to do it for myself. However there will always be unknowns where I’m like “what is this? What do I do?” and am completely lost.

My boyfriend says he won’t let that happen. I just hate how gung-ho he is whereas I’m in so much agony and fear! I don’t feel safe! I don’t wanna be homeless!

I only have my boyfriend. I don’t have anyone else. I wish I had better parents.

The Circle K burned down. Pizza Amore got rid of their breakfast meals. Wing House doesn’t have desserts or sandwiches. No one is hiring me. I want to move. But we can’t. Not just because of our lease but because money is frighteningly tight.

We can forego useless pleasures, but it’s still not enough.

I’m so jealous of people with pretty rooms and a clean house and time energy and motivation to stay fit. Clothes are expensive. The weather stinks! It should be springtime already!

I’ve gone without eating then I eat till I’m sick. Just to fill the void of ennui.

There’s this guy who is offering 600 $ for a week-end of fun. No I’m serious. I’m gonna take it. Rent. Rent. RENT! Car payments! Fuckin hydro! We still haven’t had warm water in months! I’ve never showered at home since. I don’t remember the last time I did. I don’t smell too bad. Some guys are into that. But it’s just another reminder that I’m suffering from poverty. Something my family never knew for generations. But of course I’m the prodigal son. The black sheep.

My boyfriend lost his job and does part time work now at an auto parts shoppe and does SkipTheDishes whenever he’s off work. Even during the same day. So I never have the car. But it’s not about me. I can’t be selfish. We need this…to live.

I need….. I need a bed buddy. I need a cry buddy. W-wow I didn’t even think about my own boyfriend… we are not exclusive but.. I felt that. I feel the need for someone outside my situation I guess. Psychiatry is weird.",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908

I just feel so lonely. Im only 17 years old. My parents good divorced almost 8 years ago and ive been abused by my stepmom for as long as she came into our life. I lived a life of constant , anxiety , sadness, loneliness and helplessness. And since my mother went in italy to live there five years ago it didnt make things easier for me. Even now that i live with my grandma there are times where i argue with her and she just tells me to go back to my home. And i dont want to play the role of the victim because i act like an asshole as well. I just wish i didnt feel like unwanted trash, i wish i could be happy. I have thought of killing myself multiple times as well, i even tried drinking soap once when i was younger because i thought it would work. And now as im older i still have to. I dont see myself having a life in here, even now im planning to kill myself with paracetamols but its so scary. But then even if its painful for two days it will finally be over. And if theres an afterlife maybe ill be happy somewhere out there.Just not here.

Why do i feel pressured?,"My family is always telling me i'm do incredibly smart, that i have a lot of talent yada yada yada, the truth is i'm nobody capable of achieving absolutly nothing, like half an hour ago my grandma was on the phone speaking with my mom, about how i wasnt able to help her with a call she made to the US (my country it's spanish speaker, not english, and i have problems understanding what people say on the phone aswell) and since grandma always calls with speaker on, i heard my mom say ""He's supposed to speak English without problem"" i just yelled at them that it wasnt my fucking problem, i didnt care and even if i was able to help i wouldnt, and, like, half the people in my life tell me how smart i am, that just by talking to me you can notice it, etc, and on the other end of the line, people will tell me how much of a fucking idiot i am, that anyone in the world could do that simple task 100 times better than me, etc, theres no in between, and who i'm supposed to believe?? If you somehow feel like you want to talk to me go ahead, i actually kinda want it because nobody answers on any social media anymore, and i got nobody to talk to, again, yipe",depression,,US,39.7837304,-100.445882
"Not ""bad"" enough to be taken seriously.","I feel like all my problems are classified as *""not bad enough""* to be taken seriously.

I went to the doctor this morning because I needed help. I told her that I don’t feel helped enough, that every psychologist I’ve seen so far hasn’t really made a difference, and that I’m currently dealing with anxiety attacks and terrible sleep. My current psychologist appointments are **two months apart**—that’s how *""not bad""* I apparently am.

I was hoping for something—anything—that would provide some short-term relief. Instead, she just increased my Effexor dosage, which will take weeks to have any effect. Her advice? *If it gets worse, come back.*

That’s it. No validation, no real discussion. Just *wait and see.*

I know my issues aren’t as extreme as others, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t real. It feels like nobody actually cares, and that just reinforces this horrible feeling that my struggles don’t matter. I want answers. I want to understand *why* I am like this. I don’t want to feel so alone in it all.

I don’t even know who to share this with. My friends and family are all struggling with their own issues, and I don’t want to add to their burdens. So I just sit with it, stuck in this loop of feeling unheard and unseen.

Has anyone else been through this? How do you deal with feeling like your problems aren’t *""bad enough""* to matter?",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
"I'm 16 and I've always had a terrible life, I wanna kill myself","I'm 16 and I've always hated my life as I never really had anything good happen to me, I've been living just for the sake of it without putting any thought into it for years. I don't really want to live but death is just too scary for someone like me so it's really hard to actually commit suicide.

I've always had a terrible family and no friends pretty much, I never really felt connected to the world around me and I don't really feel like I belong here too much, for some reason I exist and I guess I have to make use of it somehow.

I didn't go to school much as I didn't really see the need for much education and my dad never really liked or went to school himself and days when I did go to school I really didn't want to I just had to. I had mental health issues from a very early age and I was treated badly in both my house and in school so I felt really depressed already early on.

My family have hit me, always scolded me for being who I am. Whether that'd be just me laying down in bed all day, or just playing games and all that. They wanted me to always work and living in this environment I've actually grown up to be a workaholic later on.

I never really had mental or physical care so I feel like I've lived in an environment that just isn't ""normal"" and yeah the life I live certainly isn't ""normal""

I was bullied around in school and was sort of alone, back a few years ago when I was in school (before 2020) I would not talk to anyone and just go to school feeling like shit, when I came back I just wanted to play games and do nothing else, I hated the way things just were. When I used to talk to people I still felt like I didn't really make much sense or connect to them in anyway, I felt that people didn't love me, and maybe it was because they didn't or it was just me.

Ever since 2020 and after I've just been living home not doing anything other than gaming, masturbating, watching YouTube and listening to music and whatnot. I just go for cheap entertainment because it calms me down and gets the time spending fast.

I still have hope for my future, back in 2023 I met a girl and we've been friends for some time, I can't stop thinking about her and I think I want to spend my entire life with her, it would help me escape from my bad childhood and she also hasn't had a good childhood either so it's kind of a relief to have someone that understands what you go through. Even if she ain't going to be in a perfect mental state it's better than the sons of bitches I live with right now.

I need to move to England and in order to do this I need a 5 year visa (as far as I understand not 100% sure) and stay in England for 5 years then I can get a indefinite visa which allows me to stay for a life-time.

During those 5 years I want to be with my friend and live together, I want to spend my life with her and move on from the pain that has been my life up to this point.

I would like someone to tell me how good of a plan this is as I need someone else to tell me it's good because I don't have enough self-confidence to know if this is good.

Please reply if you've read this post this far. I wanted to share my feelings because I feel better when I do but I hope you have something to say that might make me feel better.",depression,,England,52.5310214,-1.2649062

"I always try so damn hard my whole life to be better, and it’s never enough. I’m gonna finally die.","(Context: I was a foreign student) Okay well basically I (19M) was getting panic attacks everyday in the UK from September to December, due to a bunch of trauma related to education when I got severe depression in the past. The Uni I was in had a lot of not so great people either. Anyway, at the tail end of December I attempted to take my life with scissors slicing my throat open but then the nurse caught me and I was under watch for the rest of the night at the uni. I was put under the National health care service (NHS) where their crisis team would check me everyday to make I hadn’t died or killed myself. They gave me two different medications which made me even worse. It messed up my brain chemistry. 

Everything from here happened in January.
Then in the beginning of January I was hurting myself by cutting my arms and legs with scissors and keys. Whereby then I went absolutely insane during one of their visits and they thought I was really gonna die so they forcefully admitted me into a psychiatric ward in the town over. If I didn’t come willingly they would’ve forced me in there and sectioned me. So when I was there I was around many different people. Constantly hearing screams at night and completely delusional people as well. I was completely manic some days. I met this girl there. Her name was Wendy (19F). After staying the ward a couple days, we both realised we loved each other and got into a relationship. She was my first girlfriend. She had BPD. From that day we hung out all the time. Due to her BPD she can switch to someone horrible when she drinks too much. So when we went on a bender with another friend I made there by sneaking out of the hospital, I got incredibly drunk as we walked around town blasting music and drinking. So when we got back I couldn’t move because I was so drunk I may puke. But because she drank too much she switched and started calling me horrible names and everything. I cried. The next day she explained to me how the BPD works and that she’s sorry. I know how sweet and amazing she is in reality, plus I loved her. So I forgave her. Fast forward a couple of days she has to leave the ward because she’s been in too long and she deicdes to stays with her friend. Long story short, she stole money from me and tried to steal money from her the next morning. Kicking her out immediately that same morning. Wendy was depressed and hurt and I spent nearly 8 hours meeting up with her and finding her a place to live somewhere in town because she’s basically homeless. Lost 200 GBP in a stupid mistake in trying to get her lodging. I managed to get another friend I met in the ward to give her a place to stay. Then I went back to the ward myself. I was then told the next day that I was being discharged even though I wasn’t ready and I was terrified. None of the other patients want me to leave as they know I’m not ready but I just got an asshole doctor which discharged me. So a couple days pass and I’m sent back to my uni lodgings at night. The moment I enter my room I have a panic attack and hurt myself. I find out they forgot to give me my medicine too. I rush back that same night despite exhaustion and when ur each the hospital I break down in front of the ward. Crying and nearly vomiting on staff because I wanted to go back in. I was on the floor puking in the bathroom screaming and saying I was gonna kill myself. They said they couldn’t take me so they tried taking me to action and emergency. But then I was so scared. So they drugged me up heavily with Promethazine (Muscle relaxant) so that I wouldn’t be able to think or move or speak. And sent me back to the uni. So a couple days go by and I’m practically bed ridden in my room unable to speak without slurring due to the amount I’m given. The next day I’m made to be in a meeting with the head academic supervisor of the university and my school counsellor. They tell me that I either voluntarily leave the uni through withdrawing my visa or they force me out by eliminating my visa forcefully. By this point I was insane. So then I had to mediate between my dad and mum as I had to pretend I loved my dad more and want his support because he can afford to bring me back. So in essence I decided to withdraw my visa voluntarily. And my dad would come pick me up in a week. Then Wendy wanted to stay at my place for a day as she was free. So she came over and she slept over in my room. The next day I had to organise a meeting with the uni people including higher ups to prep them with what to say to my dad that would not legally get them in trouble or screw me over when he asks questions as if he’s mad my life may have been over. But while this is happening, Wendy was crying on the phone because her mother was being horrible and forced her away from me and she was breaking down on street in town while on the phone with me on the way to my meeting. After all that I went back to my room where before she was forced away she had cleaned my room. I broke down in tears crying. I still couldn’t rest, shortly after the crisis team came to check on me and I was completely manic and insane speaking to them. A couple days pass and Wendy is able to stay over now until my dad picks me up. She missed me and wanted to stay with me until then. So she comes over and we just hangout together and love each other. I made sure the laundry was done and the room tidy. That the bedsheets were clean and warm and that the coffee she loved I had. I set up movies, cuddle spaces, I gave her the best side of her bed and paid for her food. We had sex and I helped her open up more, and comfort her when her mother is being a horrible person. I help teach her to feel her feeling better. But then two nights before I leave, we decided to drink a little. I was against it but she promised she wouldn’t drink a lot so okay. I accidentally drink too much and I’m feeling sick. Wendy in the midst of finally feeling her own feelings for the first time in a while thinks she hurt me and tries kill herself in my bathroom while cutting up her body with a razor. So when she exited she had overdosed and was bleeding all over. Leaving my bathroom all red too. Im still heavily drunk so I keep feeling like puling but I try my best to remind her it’s all okay. She collapses and I think she died. I desperately get my neighbour to call the ambulance. I get them on the phone and Wendy wakes up to stop me from getting the ambulance to come saying she’s okay. I black out in my bed thinking she’s dying. I wake up and afraid she might be dying as we talk and all but I try to stay calm. So we talk and sort things out and she says she won’t do it again. We have a big dinner as it is our last night and I take her stargazing. The next day comes and I have to see my abusive dad. That happens. Instead of taking me to Malaysia he decides to use this opportunity to holiday. We reach the hotel and I’m shaking, panicking, crying, and shivering on the floor because of everything that has happened and is happening. He ignores me. A few days go bye and I keep in regular contact with Wendy and a friend Mark. Wendy is staying with Mark temporarily after she stayed with me. So those days pass while I’m jsut unable to do much without wanting to kill or hurt myself. Then I get horrible messages sent to me from Wendy. Completely insulting me and berating me. Calling me nasty things. I find out she tried kill herself again via overdose and my friend Mark drove her to action and emergency. She was spouting horrible things about him too so the hospital kicked him out. Then the last thing she told me was that she was dying and that I’m a horrible person. Her BPD activated because she was jsut beginning to feel her feelings and accept who she is, but also letting me in and not having her meds since she tried to overdose on them in my bathroom. Next thing I know she ran away from the hospital, threw her phone away in a random park and went missing. My dad continues to mess me up while I’m in the hotel. The whole thing with Wendy messed Mark up and he tied to kill himself multiple times while I tried to stop him over the phone. Then my dad took me on the plane back to Malaysia while being incredibly mad at me for panicking. I reached home and without medicine I was combatant trying to kill myself. I gave myself a concussion and tried to scratch my arms. My little brother threw away my self harm fork. I wa made to see a therapist which tried to put me in another ward which was the picture. I managed to avoid it somehow Then through a lot of begging behind the scenes I was allowed to see a psychiatrist. 

This is February.
My dad wanted to send me but he was getting mad while we were waiting in the hospital. He burst into my appointment and scolded my doctor then left. After my appointment, he was screaming how horrible my mum is in front of the hospital. The next couple days he tried to get me to cut all ties with my mum because he thinks she had an affair while they were married and is brainwashing us. He still hasn’t gotten over her. He tried to take legal action against me to leave his house because I might kill myself. Everyday it’s like I’m thirsty in a desert and there’s a huge bottle of water right in front of me. That water is to die. It’s like an itch to kill myself and I really want to scratch it every second. The new medication from the doctor has made me more sane now that I can speak and type. Without it I’d be unrecognisable. Completely insane, crazy, swearing, slurring, louder and just nuts. So after that I was given an ultimatum to either stay with my abusive father or live with my mum. The answer sounds easy but I couldn’t choose to stay with my mum. If I leave my dad, I’d lose out on inheritance I have been fighting for for 19 years, lose my ability to go overseas to study, my you’d be brother could lose stability, I’d force my mum back from her new life in Australia, strain her relationship there with her boyfriend and take money away from my brothers’ future funds from my mum  to afford my education costs. I felt too guilty and couldn’t do it even if I may kill myself. My your younger brother and mum want me to stay with her but I just can’t. I’d would take away so much from everyone. Despite having done so much for all of them. So I sucked up to my dad and managed to avoid having to cut all ties with my mum. I still want to kill my self everyday. It is so hard not to do it. It drives me mad. I’m now visiting my mum and not killing is so hard. 

Obviously there’s a lot more detail but this is what has happened. I’ll probably die soon.

Even before this my dad put me through so much Abuse. Physical, emotional, financial. He’s nearly killed me. I’m just so unlovable, I’m so fucking unlovable. I’m ugly, stupid, worthless and disgusting. Fuck me. Fuck this. I’m fucking tired. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. Nobody will ever love me. I know it’s wrong to peg your self perception on another person and I was working on that for years and it was getting better. But what if you life’s whole goal in the back of your mind was to find proof that you were capable of being loved and you finally got it? That’s how I felt. That my life was completed. That I was done with that part. But no. Of course not. Fuck me always fuck me. The meds are barely keeping me sane enough to eat talk, type and walk. I want to stop it, so no more concussion I give myself but truly death. Pure and fucking simple. I want to do it so badly. Of course if I truly wanted to die I’d just do it. That’s why I need to be off the meds to full do it. So I can finally be at peace.

I feel really really bad. I’m gonna throw my meds out and stop this fucking shit. I fucking hate living. I know I’ve gotten bitter and I never wanted to get bitter, but fuck everyone else who just has it so swell. I know so many of them so personally and I know they haven’t had to try even an increment of what I have in an attempt to feel happy. I’m so bitter now. I used to be so afraid of becoming bitter. FUCK THEM. FUCK THEM FOR HAVING IT SO FUCKING EASY FUCK THEM FOR BEING HAPPY I FUCKING I HATE MYSELF FUCK FUCK FUCK I JUST WANT TO BE FUCKING HAPPY PLEASE IS THAT SO BAD. But no. I’m not allowed to live stably and normally in a sense. Of course I’m not. I’m writing this at 2am, it’s getting closer it’s finally coming. All that’s left is throwing away the medicine. Fucking finally.

"I always try so damn hard my whole life to be better, and it’s never enough. I’m gonna finally die.","(Context: I was a foreign student) Okay well basically I (19M) was getting panic attacks everyday in the UK from September to December, due to a bunch of trauma related to education when I got severe depression in the past. The Uni I was in had a lot of not so great people either. Anyway, at the tail end of December I attempted to take my life with scissors slicing my throat open but then the nurse caught me and I was under watch for the rest of the night at the uni. I was put under the National health care service (NHS) where their crisis team would check me everyday to make I hadn’t died or killed myself. They gave me two different medications which made me even worse. It messed up my brain chemistry. 

Everything from here happened in January.
Then in the beginning of January I was hurting myself by cutting my arms and legs with scissors and keys. Whereby then I went absolutely insane during one of their visits and they thought I was really gonna die so they forcefully admitted me into a psychiatric ward in the town over. If I didn’t come willingly they would’ve forced me in there and sectioned me. So when I was there I was around many different people. Constantly hearing screams at night and completely delusional people as well. I was completely manic some days. I met this girl there. Her name was Wendy (19F). After staying the ward a couple days, we both realised we loved each other and got into a relationship. She was my first girlfriend. She had BPD. From that day we hung out all the time. Due to her BPD she can switch to someone horrible when she drinks too much. So when we went on a bender with another friend I made there by sneaking out of the hospital, I got incredibly drunk as we walked around town blasting music and drinking. So when we got back I couldn’t move because I was so drunk I may puke. But because she drank too much she switched and started calling me horrible names and everything. I cried. The next day she explained to me how the BPD works and that she’s sorry. I know how sweet and amazing she is in reality, plus I loved her. So I forgave her. Fast forward a couple of days she has to leave the ward because she’s been in too long and she deicdes to stays with her friend. Long story short, she stole money from me and tried to steal money from her the next morning. Kicking her out immediately that same morning. Wendy was depressed and hurt and I spent nearly 8 hours meeting up with her and finding her a place to live somewhere in town because she’s basically homeless. Lost 200 GBP in a stupid mistake in trying to get her lodging. I managed to get another friend I met in the ward to give her a place to stay. Then I went back to the ward myself. I was then told the next day that I was being discharged even though I wasn’t ready and I was terrified. None of the other patients want me to leave as they know I’m not ready but I just got an asshole doctor which discharged me. So a couple days pass and I’m sent back to my uni lodgings at night. The moment I enter my room I have a panic attack and hurt myself. I find out they forgot to give me my medicine too. I rush back that same night despite exhaustion and when ur each the hospital I break down in front of the ward. Crying and nearly vomiting on staff because I wanted to go back in. I was on the floor puking in the bathroom screaming and saying I was gonna kill myself. They said they couldn’t take me so they tried taking me to action and emergency. But then I was so scared. So they drugged me up heavily with Promethazine (Muscle relaxant) so that I wouldn’t be able to think or move or speak. And sent me back to the uni. So a couple days go by and I’m practically bed ridden in my room unable to speak without slurring due to the amount I’m given. The next day I’m made to be in a meeting with the head academic supervisor of the university and my school counsellor. They tell me that I either voluntarily leave the uni through withdrawing my visa or they force me out by eliminating my visa forcefully. By this point I was insane.

"I always try so damn hard my whole life to be better, and it’s never enough. I’m gonna finally die.","(Context: I was a foreign student) Okay well basically I (19M) was getting panic attacks everyday in the UK from September to December, due to a bunch of trauma related to education when I got severe depression in the past. The Uni I was in had a lot of not so great people either. Anyway, at the tail end of December I attempted to take my life with scissors slicing my throat open but then the nurse caught me and I was under watch for the rest of the night at the uni. I was put under the National health care service (NHS) where their crisis team would check me everyday to make I hadn’t died or killed myself. They gave me two different medications which made me even worse. It messed up my brain chemistry. 

Everything from here happened in January.
Then in the beginning of January I was hurting myself by cutting my arms and legs with scissors and keys. Whereby then I went absolutely insane during one of their visits and they thought I was really gonna die so they forcefully admitted me into a psychiatric ward in the town over. If I didn’t come willingly they would’ve forced me in there and sectioned me. So when I was there I was around many different people. Constantly hearing screams at night and completely delusional people as well. I was completely manic some days. I met this girl there. Her name was Wendy (19F). After staying the ward a couple days, we both realised we loved each other and got into a relationship. She was my first girlfriend. She had BPD. From that day we hung out all the time. Due to her BPD she can switch to someone horrible when she drinks too much. So when we went on a bender with another friend I made there by sneaking out of the hospital, I got incredibly drunk as we walked around town blasting music and drinking. So when we got back I couldn’t move because I was so drunk I may puke. But because she drank too much she switched and started calling me horrible names and everything. I cried. The next day she explained to me how the BPD works and that she’s sorry. I know how sweet and amazing she is in reality, plus I loved her. So I forgave her. Fast forward a couple of days she has to leave the ward because she’s been in too long and she deicdes to stays with her friend. Long story short, she stole money from me and tried to steal money from her the next morning. Kicking her out immediately that same morning. Wendy was depressed and hurt and I spent nearly 8 hours meeting up with her and finding her a place to live somewhere in town because she’s basically homeless. Lost 200 GBP in a stupid mistake in trying to get her lodging. I managed to get another friend I met in the ward to give her a place to stay. Then I went back to the ward myself. I was then told the next day that I was being discharged even though I wasn’t ready and I was terrified. None of the other patients want me to leave as they know I’m not ready but I just got an asshole doctor which discharged me. So a couple days pass and I’m sent back to my uni lodgings at night. The moment I enter my room I have a panic attack and hurt myself. I find out they forgot to give me my medicine too. I rush back that same night despite exhaustion and when ur each the hospital I break down in front of the ward. Crying and nearly vomiting on staff because I wanted to go back in. I was on the floor puking in the bathroom screaming and saying I was gonna kill myself. They said they couldn’t take me so they tried taking me to action and emergency. But then I was so scared. So they drugged me up heavily with Promethazine (Muscle relaxant) so that I wouldn’t be able to think or move or speak. And sent me back to the uni. So a couple days go by and I’m practically bed ridden in my room unable to speak without slurring due to the amount I’m given. The next day I’m made to be in a meeting with the head academic supervisor of the university and my school counsellor. They tell me that I either voluntarily leave the uni through withdrawing my visa or they force me out by eliminating my visa forcefully. By this point I was insane. So then I had to mediate between my dad and mum as I had to pretend I loved my dad more and want his support because he can afford to bring me back. So in essence I decided to withdraw my visa voluntarily. And my dad would come pick me up in a week. Then Wendy wanted to stay at my place for a day as she was free. So she came over and she slept over in my room. The next day I had to organise a meeting with the uni people including higher ups to prep them with what to say to my dad that would not legally get them in trouble or screw me over when he asks questions as if he’s mad my life may have been over. But while this is happening, Wendy was crying on the phone because her mother was being horrible and forced her away from me and she was breaking down on street in town while on the phone with me on the way to my meeting. After all that I went back to my room where before she was forced away she had cleaned my room. I broke down in tears crying. I still couldn’t rest, shortly after the crisis team came to check on me and I was completely manic and insane speaking to them. A couple days pass and Wendy is able to stay over now until my dad picks me up. She missed me and wanted to stay with me until then. So she comes over and we just hangout together and love each other. I made sure the laundry was done and the room tidy. That the bedsheets were clean and warm and that the coffee she loved I had. I set up movies, cuddle spaces, I gave her the best side of her bed and paid for her food. We had sex and I helped her open up more, and comfort her when her mother is being a horrible person. I help teach her to feel her feeling better. But then two nights before I leave, we decided to drink a little. I was against it but she promised she wouldn’t drink a lot so okay. I accidentally drink too much and I’m feeling sick. Wendy in the midst of finally feeling her own feelings for the first time in a while thinks she hurt me and tries kill herself in my bathroom while cutting up her body with a razor. So when she exited she had overdosed and was bleeding all over. Leaving my bathroom all red too. Im still heavily drunk so I keep feeling like puling but I try my best to remind her it’s all okay. She collapses and I think she died. I desperately get my neighbour to call the ambulance. I get them on the phone and Wendy wakes up to stop me from getting the ambulance to come saying she’s okay. I black out in my bed thinking she’s dying. I wake up and afraid she might be dying as we talk and all but I try to stay calm. So we talk and sort things out and she says she won’t do it again. We have a big dinner as it is our last night and I take her stargazing. The next day comes and I have to see my abusive dad. That happens. Instead of taking me to Malaysia he decides to use this opportunity to holiday. We reach the hotel and I’m shaking, panicking, crying, and shivering on the floor because of everything that has happened and is happening. He ignores me. A few days go bye and I keep in regular contact with Wendy and a friend Mark. Wendy is staying with Mark temporarily after she stayed with me. So those days pass while I’m jsut unable to do much without wanting to kill or hurt myself. Then I get horrible messages sent to me from Wendy. Completely insulting me and berating me. Calling me nasty things. I find out she tried kill herself again via overdose and my friend Mark drove her to action and emergency. She was spouting horrible things about him too so the hospital kicked him out. Then the last thing she told me was that she was dying and that I’m a horrible person. Her BPD activated because she was jsut beginning to feel her feelings and accept who she is, but also letting me in and not having her meds since she tried to overdose on them in my bathroom. Next thing I know she ran away from the hospital, threw her phone away in a random park and went missing. My dad continues to mess me up while I’m in the hotel. The whole thing with Wendy messed Mark up and he tied to kill himself multiple times while I tried to stop him over the phone. Then my dad took me on the plane back to Malaysia while being incredibly mad at me for panicking. I reached home and without medicine I was combatant trying to kill myself. I gave myself a concussion and tried to scratch my arms. My little brother threw away my self harm fork. I wa made to see a therapist which tried to put me in another ward which was the picture. I managed to avoid it somehow Then through a lot of begging behind the scenes I was allowed to see a psychiatrist. 

This is February.
My dad wanted to send me but he was getting mad while we were waiting in the hospital. He burst into my appointment and scolded my doctor then left. After my appointment, he was screaming how horrible my mum is in front of the hospital. The next couple days he tried to get me to cut all ties with my mum because he thinks she had an affair while they were married and is brainwashing us. He still hasn’t gotten over her. He tried to take legal action against me to leave his house because I might kill myself. Everyday it’s like I’m thirsty in a desert and there’s a huge bottle of water right in front of me. That water is to die. It’s like an itch to kill myself and I really want to scratch it every second. The new medication from the doctor has made me more sane now that I can speak and type. Without it I’d be unrecognisable. Completely insane, crazy, swearing, slurring, louder and just nuts. So after that I was given an ultimatum to either stay with my abusive father or live with my mum. The answer sounds easy but I couldn’t choose to stay with my mum. If I leave my dad, I’d lose out on inheritance I have been fighting for for 19 years, lose my ability to go overseas to study, my you’d be brother could lose stability, I’d force my mum back from her new life in Australia, strain her relationship there with her boyfriend and take money away from my brothers’ future funds from my mum  to afford my education costs. I felt too guilty and couldn’t do it even if I may kill myself. My your younger brother and mum want me to stay with her but I just can’t. I’d would take away so much from everyone. Despite having done so much for all of them. So I sucked up to my dad and managed to avoid having to cut all ties with my mum. I still want to kill my self everyday. It is so hard not to do it. It drives me mad. I’m now visiting my mum and not killing is so hard. 

Obviously there’s a lot more detail but this is what has happened. I’ll probably die soon.

Even before this my dad put me through so much Abuse. Physical, emotional, financial. He’s nearly killed me. I’m just so unlovable, I’m so fucking unlovable. I’m ugly, stupid, worthless and disgusting. Fuck me. Fuck this. I’m fucking tired. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. Nobody will ever love me. I know it’s wrong to peg your self perception on another person and I was working on that for years and it was getting better. But what if you life’s whole goal in the back of your mind was to find proof that you were capable of being loved and you finally got it? That’s how I felt. That my life was completed. That I was done with that part. But no. Of course not. Fuck me always fuck me. The meds are barely keeping me sane enough to eat talk, type and walk. I want to stop it, so no more concussion I give myself but truly death. Pure and fucking simple. I want to do it so badly. Of course if I truly wanted to die I’d just do it. That’s why I need to be off the meds to full do it. So I can finally be at peace.

I feel really really bad. I’m gonna throw my meds out and stop this fucking shit. I fucking hate living. I know I’ve gotten bitter and I never wanted to get bitter, but fuck everyone else who just has it so swell. I know so many of them so personally and I know they haven’t had to try even an increment of what I have in an attempt to feel happy. I’m so bitter now. I used to be so afraid of becoming bitter. FUCK THEM. FUCK THEM FOR HAVING IT SO FUCKING EASY FUCK THEM FOR BEING HAPPY I FUCKING I HATE MYSELF FUCK FUCK FUCK I JUST WANT TO BE FUCKING HAPPY PLEASE IS THAT SO BAD. But no. I’m not allowed to live stably and normally in a sense. Of course I’m not. I’m writing this at 2am, it’s getting closer it’s finally coming. All that’s left is throwing away the medicine.

Stuck in a limbo of wanting to die but can’t end it,"Since I turned 15 I’ve been stuck in this state of wanting to just die but I can’t- my mom doesn’t really care she’s more just understandably frustrated with me.

I’m lost I can’t even watch tv or movies anymore or scroll on social media wishing I could have any other life but mine. At first thinking well others have it worse than me used to help but now :/ I straight up smoke, daydream and cry lmao",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
I Need Help,"I need help.  Six months ago, my partner of three years broke up with me.  He kicked me out of his house that he promised me was my own home as well.  He was abusive in every way there is: emotionally, mentally, verbally, and physically.  For whatever reason, I loved him and cannot seem to get over this break up.  
I am unemployed due to an injury, but do not qualify for unemployment benefits, or social security benefits.  Even if I did, it would not be enough to live off of.  I have been diagnosed with complex PTSD, persistent depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety, ADHD.  I've been able to pull myself up out of the hole of depression multiple times in the past, but this time is very different.  
I cannot seem to find hope, motivation, ambition, or the desire for anything.  I don't care to see anyone, hear anyone, do anything, hang out with anyone anywhere, get a job, find a place to live, and if I didn't have to get out of bed, I wouldn't.  I am forty years old and had to move back in with my parents when my ex kicked me out of his house.  I avoid my parents at all cost because I'll probably just disappoint them, and they'll absolutely get onto me about what I ""should"" do.  
Granted, I should probably listen to them and just do whatever they say, as it's better for me than whatever the hell I do on my own now.  


Nothing in the town where I live is affordable.  I mean nothing.  I have no college degree, no special skills that are worth mentioning, and to sum it up pretty accurately, I'm a loser, just as my ex told me I am.  
I've got nothing.  If I keep going on like this, I'm just going to die.  Heartbreak, depression, carelessness, I don't know what from, but I can feel it.  I'm in no way saying that I am going to harm myself intentionally at all.  I just feel sick.  Not as in virus sick, but like, just sick.  Almost like how I hear what it's like to experience failure to thrive.

I have no clue what I need to do, but I'm wondering if any of you have some experience to share... Thank you if so.  Even if you don't, just thanks for reading and for being here.",depression,,Heartbreak,50.5110565312352,-120.46418522421844
involuntarily commited last week,"I was recently involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital after i told someone i was riding around with a gun ready to kill myself because I'm so tired of being depressed and lonely.

"A trace of joy - written in the middle of something dark, but not without hope","
I wrote this some time ago, during a period when depression had consumed every part of me.
I tried to capture the feeling of hope, that maybe next time will be the last time.
That if I really try, really fight, maybe I won’t end up down here again.
I hope someone out there reads this and recognizes themselves, and feels, even for a moment - I am not alone. 

-
You appear quietly, almost disarming me.
You wait in silence,
reappearing when I dare to forget you.
But I'm not afraid of you.
Monotonous,
alone,
and tired, 
but not afraid.

I used to be afraid,
deeply…
When you emerged only in dark times,
cloaked in silence.
But I was younger then,
seeing danger through a child’s eyes.
It’s still the same shadows, 
just a different light.

You still come to me with the dark,
speaking to my weaker sides,
trying to pull me beneath the surface.
But the truth is- 
I need you.
I’ve never been above the surface.
I exist in the grey,
always fading lower.

I slip into the dark,
slowly...
into the hollow that never ends...
into absolute loneliness.
into a void so real, 
I could describe its shape.

That’s when you come.
My worst nightmares.

You cling to me,
adding weight to the descent I was already in.
And when the dark has claimed every inch of me,
I feel it.. 
the bottom.

The bottom where I find
a rare sense of steadiness.
Where I feel stillness,
in a sea of chaos.

I stand there quietly,
picking through the ruins of what I once felt.
Comparing memories,
searching for glimpses of joy and love, 
echoes of love I saw in others,
but never held myself… 

The quiet joy on a child’s face
when he sees his mother in the doorway. 
no thoughts,
no why,
only the feeling of love.

The couple celebrating forty years of marriage.
Changed by time,
shaped by life...
but in their eyes,
nothing has ever changed.

A family pouring love into a man, 
their son,
their brother, 
when I can no longer love myself.

I focus, 
I need to find it! 
I push off with determination,
leaving you behind, 
the overthinking,
the confusion.

Crawling through the layers
of emptiness and self-hate.
Kicking blindly in panic,
almost breaking through the sorrow,
the fear. 
until I see it… 

That flicker.
That polarizing shimmer, 
so close… 

So close I can almost feel
the sun warming my skin.
So close I can make out
a child's laughter through the noise.
So close I almost begin to remember
what love might feel like.

But I begin to sink again,
quietly.
Barely aware of it.
But this time,
I sink- 
with a trace of joy.

What I’ve seen
is enough to give me hope. 
hope that next time,
I’ll make it all the way.

So I wait.
Listening for your whispers.

My worst nightmares.
My dearest friends.

Idek what im saying, for real, i just want love, im losing my mind. I ONLY KNEW HAPPINESS ONCE IN MY LIFE, and I lost her. I wished to die someday before her. She was the only light i saw in my entire life. Everything was fine with her, i didnt want to be perfect or strive for perfection anymore with her, she was perfect, im shaking only for typing this. But now shes gone. She erased everything bad from my life, i saw light in it for once. But now, Im losing hope. Everyday i wake up and solemnly remember those who lost their lives by depression and try to pay respect to them and try to strive, but im losing hope.

I’m to that point.,Never thought to post this on Reddit but as a marine who’s been in Afghanistan and has seen it all. I think I’ve just have to be done with life at the moment. I’m tired of the meetings that don’t work the medication that doesn’t work. I’m tired of closing my eyes and seeing nothing and waking up and seeing nothing. Hardest thing I’ve had to do was try to re adjust even after years. I’ve had multiple guns to my head and have never been able to pull the trigger. I don’t know how in 2 years my life can come crashing down and would be suffering from mental health and suicide. I see how people live and I’m here taking one day at a time thinking today is the day that says the date next to my casket. Never really had a father figure and the one father figure I had was my grandpa and he passed away due to Parkinson’s. All I know is where I’m at peace in life id always by the water. Not necessarily the ocean but just water. It calms me naturally. Eating has been harder and harder each day and when I do eat it’s like I don’t have apetite. Used to be solid muscle and went straight to the gym 7 days a week. My motivation has died with me years ago when I got boots back to the states. Worst thing i probably did was get out the corps. I’m 30 years old and when I got out financially I was set and had things going at least. Invested a 1/4 of a million into an investment I had thought with a friend and his dad ended up stealing that money and my friends money who now has leukemia and is now dying. Got into a car accident and came out with 6 surgeries. If someone did black magic on me I would believe it at this point. It’s gotten to where crying myself to sleep like an infant is the norm and thinking of ways to end it are things that I do. Because of this my significant other got an abortion because raising a baby in these times wouldn’t be good. Needless to say we broke up. The worst part is waking up because when I’m asleep I face my demons and stand up to them with my grandfather and my brothers that I lost by my side just like the protector I was born to be. Loyal as a dog my gunny would always say. Would take a bullet for the people I love. I’m just sorry to everyone I can’t love myself the same as I love everyone else ,depression,,Afghanistan,33.7680065,66.2385139
I hate myself,"This is long so bare with me, I'm a 20 year old male, I have anxiety, depression, and I guess I'm suicidal, well to the point where I just don't want to live anymore.

I hate myself, I hate they way that I look, I hate the way that I speak. I’m a pathetic loser who hates working, who is still terribly shy! And never had a girlfriend.

High school for me was a joke, I was average, I hungout with the weirdos because they liked the same stuff as me, I never struggled in school, besides the fact that I hated going, and attendance took a hit, I remember going to the deans office for it, and him going over how attendance is important so that you can keep up with you classes and yadda yadda, then he pulled up my grades and noticed it was all As and Bs even after the fact I missed nearly 2 weeks of school and he basically told me to come the school, I felt smug that day. 

I really didn't know what to do with myself, I stopped playing football in middle school, because I didn't like it, and my body took a hit for it, I won't sugar coat it, I'm fat, I'm not the worse, like I'm 5’9 and 240ib, still obese, and I'm also incredibly shy, I will not answer phone calls that I don't know, I'll let them ring, then if they leave a voicemail I'll maybe call them back, this anxiety has been my source of dread for years, I hated looking for jobs, because of this, I hate working with people I don't know, I hate trying to order food in person, and I hate being this pathetic, this and the fact that I mumble and talk fast doesn't help, I naturally do this and it's sucks, and I can't pronounce my words correctly it's hard for me to pronounce Rs and THs, my Rs I leave out sometimes, and the THs turn into Fs so the word ""the"" becomes ""fhe"", and I always get asked to repeat myself which tears a hole in my chest each time.

So out of highschool I was 1.Fat 2.Shy 3.Lazy, I loved playing video games and was really big into lore and stuff, anyways I thought to myself ""what is one thing I could do to hopefully fixed this""…. Military, I joined the Navy, talk to my recruiter, one of nicest guys I met, I got a big bonus, went to meps that was tough but fine, went into the future sailor program for about 2 weeks, then went to boot camp… boot camp was both the scariest and stupidest thing I went through, I watched full metal jacket when I was a kid and I knew they toned it down, and also it wasn't the Marines, but Jesus was it simple I kept my head down so hard that my RDC forgot who I was at one point thinking I wasn't in the right division, I never got personally beat, of course the whole division got beat numerous times which I was apart of, but it's not the same as having a RDC watching you do push ups or 8 counts.

I did fail the physical test closer to the end, I forgot the name, surprisingly it was only on the push ups, I made it to I think 32 before my arms locked and I gave out, and my partner didn't give me slack, which is right, but man was I pissed at the time, I retested and past like two days later, and graduated with my division… 

Now let me explain to you what was probably the best time of my life, after boot camp I went to my A school, my rate was a ETV Electrician Technician Navigation, this is a submarine rate, I won't explain much because of reasons, but imagine being paid to go to school, this was my life for a year and half, I learn about my job, and I'm done for the day if I don't have duty, I made many friends from different states, then I graduated from A school to my C school, since I picked a boomer class sub (I was 2nd in placing), and this school was located at the bottom of Georgia , and Disney world, Universal were in Liberty range, and active military can get cheaper tickets, so me and a few of my buds had a blast…

I finally made it to my actual duty station, and that's when everything went to crap, I really learned about my job and I hated it, my fellow ETV’s were great, but that didn't help, and then my shyness got ahold of me again, I won't lie my shyness never went away, boot camp was a pump not a filter, and we always travel in groups so I never was leading, and I got by on just being there, so now I was on my own and I was terrified of looking dumb and talking to all the Chiefs and first classes, so I never finished my check in packet and they kinda forgot, so I got lucky.

My first and only deployment lasted about three weeks… for me, I was working kitchen like all new shipmates do, and I hated it, I hated so much because nothing could get done, I suck at dishes and cleaning, which yes I know they are easy, add it to the list on why I hate myself, and the drills, the drills is a all hands thing, doesn't matter if your supposed to be asleep, everyone participates, so I work 12 to 12 nights in the galley, and boy did I love going into a immediate drill after getting off, which btw they take hours to complete, also get this, I'm supposed to be qualifying fish, all submarines have to qualify fish, (look it up), so my senior is breathing down my neck to qualify, and I would love to go hunt down these fellas to do a check out with them, but I'm so shy that I'm too scared to do it… and this all was boiling inside me that it caused me to lose sleep… and I just wanted it to end, I needed to escape but I'm stuck under the ocean and I'm scared and I didn't want to let anyone down and pussy out, so I took a chair to a closed door area and tied my long charger to a pipe and I was going to do it, but I got scared I didn't know what would happen, I could only hope, I don't believe in God and I don't want to go to hell, and what if none of that happens, what if, what you wanted to happen, happens. I left the room and went to Doc, he got me med evacuated off the boat and I went to the ER for a bit, and then to therapy, I decided to get out and now I have just under two years of military service under me, it doesn't get me much, my friends treated me differently, they knew I was leaving, and gradually cut ties with me.

I come home to my room being given away to my sister who got a new boyfriend after the old one ditched her when she had his baby, I lived on the couch for a bit, not really wanting a job, but I couldn't stay on the couch, so me and my other sister got a house, I paid for the down payment with what was left of my bonus, and she had a job so it's in her name, I work with her in a nursing home, I'm a cook… I hate it, I’m pathetic, I gave up so much, I don't talk to my mom anymore, my dad lives in a different state and I barely talk to him, I got nothing for my service, I'm still lazy, still fat, and still shy, and I'm technically a veteran, but I don't feel like it, and I don't go to the VA… I hate myself, I want to die but can't bring myself to kill myself because I'm scared of death, I wish to die in my sleep, or in a accident, hell if I can lose my legs and get paid to stay home that would be great… my dream was to be a YouTuber or streamer, I loved watching Markiplier, Jacksepticeye,  DanTDM, VanossGaming, and so many more growing up, and that was my dream job, I bought the set up already before moving with my sister, and it's all set up here, with the exception that my room was smaller than expected but I made due with the space.

It's ironic isn't it, that's my dream job, with all my problems that's what I want to do… I want to be happy, but I don't see it happening, I know what I am and I hate it, and I'm too lazy to change it, and I want to die because of it, I'm a waste of space, I wasted so many opportunities and now I'm laying on my bed depressed, dreading tomorrow because I have to go to work… I hate myself.

Travelling and new experiences an antidote to depression,"Long ago, when I was trapped in resistant depression, I decided to embark on a journey of self-discovery. I traveled to Nepal, India, and finally, to the Amazon.

During the early part of my journey, I stayed in ashrams and met sages of the East, experiences that helped me confront my shadows and gain clarity on what no longer served me. I encountered many people, some on a similar mission—searching for answers to personal and existential questions.

By the time I arrived in the Amazon, I began to go deeper, reconnecting with Source and nature. It was here that I believe my depression was integrated, and I found answers to essential questions: What do I want in my life? Who am I?

As my knowledge expanded, I became more accepting of the journey. It's been three years, and I am deeply grateful for the retreats and communities I've engaged with. They provided valuable insights, especially in the area of vulnerability. Gradually, I moved away from the mind and closer to the heart. I still have sad days and anxious days, but now I live through them, knowing they will pass.

This was my journey of saying goodbye to depression and embracing a new purpose and a new life.

Do you think you could benefit from spiritual encounters or connecting with people on the path of truth? If yes, are you willing to travel? Have you ever thought about it?

Reflect on this and share your thoughts. Sometimes, leaving things behind and walking a new path is exactly what we need to return to ourselves.",depression,,Nepal,28.3780464,83.9999901

I don’t know what to think or feel anymore,"Hello, I’m an 18 year old (F) and I’m just trying to figure out my life. My parents, whom I love with all my heart and soul, don’t love each other. They’re not divorced but ever since I was a kid I only see them arguing and that’s literally all they do. Somehow I always end up in the middle of it lol so it’s kind of annoying. I don’t want to sound corny or cringe but I never got support or advice on how to cope with that, so my brain literally just purposely forgets about it until I remember it again lol idk if it makes sense. But it affected my performance at school, and I know I shouldn’t let stuff like that affect me and let it stop me from doing what I’m supposed to, but it’s just so tiring seeing and knowing your parents hate each other. My dad comes and vents to me about mom, my mom comes and vents to me about him, it’s just so tiring. 

So they spent the last two nights arguing nonstop  and I overheard almost everything lol, they just argue about the same thing over and over again, and honestly I don’t blame my mom for feeling the way she feels because my dad isn’t the best husband or father. I heard him saying that he feels like we hate him so he’s distancing himself from us so that we can be happy. Which pissed me off by the way because the problem isn’t him being close to us, it’s him being far away from us because he works in another country and we see him every 2-3 months. And my mom is tired of that because all of the responsibilities is on her. I have 3 siblings btw and I’m the oldest, I’m trying my best to help. But obviously the house and the family  starts falling apart when the father isn’t present. The father is supposed to be what keeps us together and intact. A father is a leader and he’s not doing that. I worked with him for a couple of months and his job isn’t that demanding. 


Theres more to this but my point is, I’m tired, I don’t know what to feel, today the fight was pretty big and everyone was crying, I’m just so tired. Sorry for the yap and ty for reading, I’ll appreciate some feedback and advice. ",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
Tonight i'm going to kill myself,"My name is Gian and i'm from Peru, unfortunately the last you will hear from me is that I made a post on Reddit before ending my life.
I'm 22 years old and I study Software Engineering, the beginning of my depression started when my father started abusing me since I was 7 years old, I told my mom about it when I turned 18, if I'm honest with myself, I never made my mom proud during my whole life, it was something I always wanted to do, I'm not going to lie, I was making it or so I thought, since I started studying at my university I became more responsible, I learned to love myself more and focus on what's important.
My dad located me and beat me at the time of departure at my university, he broke my glasses.
To make matters worse, next week is my graduation, I have a failed course that I have to pay for or I won't be able to graduate as an engineer.
I'd rather slit my wrists right now than see my mom disappointed in me and have her tell me ""you're still the same irresponsible guy.""
This course is not even a course that I studied, the university forces you to look for a company and work without pay for 6 months, I couldn't get a company and now I'm screwed and without money to pay for that damn course :(
I have seen my mom cry many times and it has always broken my heart, I was always taught since I was little that a man should never cry, that doing that is faggy, for the first time in my life I am venting here, I am fucked and there is no solution for this, if you read this mom: ""I'm really sorry and i love You""

My life feels like a mess,"I’ve never really talked about stuff like this but I’ve hit a point where I feel like I need to tell someone. I’m 19m and I’m from Texas just to give some background. Tonight I was hit by a lot of emotions that have been building up over a long period of time. These past 2 years have been absolutely chaotic. 

Two years ago I moved out of my parents house to stay with my grandmother who is practically like my mother at this point. My parents have been so toxic and negative and harsh my whole life and I had enough of it and being there just made me feel worthless and uncared for. My grandmother who is divorced took me in and even though her house is falling apart and she doesn’t have much money, she did her best to make sure I was okay. I had also decided to move schools my senior year as I was being bullied and rumors had spread about me that weren’t true at I felt so alone and sad. Along that time my oldest sister who moved to Pennsylvania called me to let me know she was being abused and felt like her life was threatened so I drove my grandmother and I to get her and bring her back in 4 days and braved a blizzard, only for her to leave and go back 3 months later and cut contact with us months after that in May my father had a heart attack and I moved back with my parents to take care my younger sister and that situation caused so much conflict between my families. Then having to get two jobs while going to school full time to support my parents household and take care of my sister while dealing with ongoing family conflict and doctors telling me that my father is going to die and feeling so much regret. On top of that I was graduating high school and at my graduation only my grandmother showed up and it hurt me so badly because my entire family was there at the hospital arguing but couldn’t show up for me. It was so anticlimactic to walk the stage then go home and cry myself to sleep. 

While that situation resolved itself I had to drop out because I was still working two jobs and at this point just to support myself and my major required me to be at my classes which took place all day all week. Dropping out I lost access to my counselor who I spent so much time building trust and connection with and that was a big support system for me. Later that year (last fall) I started having conversations with my godparents who I never talked to and was told by my parents were terrible people. Turns out they weren’t and they took me in and fed me and housed me and gave me what I needed to live. Turns out my godmother was a lot like me growing up. Talking to her I made a lot of realizations about how my parents very much neglected me and mentally and sometimes physically abused me. Things I forgot and I assume my brain forced me to forget just so I could see my parents in a loving light. I feel like my whole life was a lie and everything I believed about myself and my family was a lie and I’m starting to see reality as what it really is. 

I’m in a stable household for the first time in a long time (or ever at all) and every instance of trauma in my life is coming back to me and times where I’ve forgotten when I’ve been abused or yelled at or neglected. I’m overwhelmed and mentally exhausted. I feel so unloved and uncared for and unimportant by everyone in my life other than the ones who directly helped me like my grandmother and my godparents. I feel like I can’t trust anyone anymore and I can’t even trust myself. The fact that I feel like my whole life was a lie makes me so upset and betrayed  that Im in disbelief that those things even happened. 

I’d like to go back to therapy but I don’t know if I can bear to explain my entire life story and have to go through trusting someone else again. I’m tired of everything and I feel lonely and stressed and angry and depression and defeated. I feel like I’ve lived an entire life time. I feel suicidal at times and I think about what I’d do, I wish a lot how I could just waltz into a forest and let the forest have my body and let it be of use to nature. I know deep down I could never do it but I always fantasize about it. I wish I could be free of my responsibilities and problems. I’m tired of crying and I’m tired of being tired.

"Need help, currently wondering if i have depression and doubting/confused about if everything i ever felt troughout my life is real.","I don't ask for sympathy nor wanna seem like i'm a victim, i, like everyone else, did shit that i regret in the past and altough i don't feel pressured about it i still find myself feeling guilty for this and that.

I also don't wanna see people thinking i'm doing or writing this for attention, it's guaranteed that there are people going trough the same right now and i feel like saying things such as ""he just wants attention"" disregards not only my concerns but the experiences of others, please keep the comments respectfull.

If you have any questions or want more details about certain parts of my life story or my point of view please let me know, i left out big big parts not only due to my memory but because i'd be here all night writing and this already took me 1 hour and an half.

This can be considered a venting post since i don't have the courage to talk about this with any person i know, i'm scared of what they might think and i also want help from more experienced people on this in a  psychological and cientific manner.


Context about myself:

Hello, i'm a 19 year old man who is currenty dealing with confusion about his emotions, identity and wants to share his point of view.

I'm currently unemployed, i study music and thinking of going to college this year.

I prefer simplicity over complexity, while people may enjoy doing activities which are considered much more interactice i simply like walking aroundz talking abiut certain things and just resting in a bench or a park while talking and just seeing others enjoying the moment.

I always liked to help people and understand them before judging, i also like to talk a lot and i usually phrase what i want to say in big detail which i have been criticised for.

I like arts, hearing people talk about what they like, games, deep convos and reflecting on things that may not be spoken about so commonly.

I have difficulty iniciating a conversation and meeting new people altough i usually don't have any probles speaking with them if theynstart the conversation first.

My life story:

I've lost my innocence at a very young age, had an abusive father and a mother that had to work everyday to make me happy.

 Because of not getting the attention i needed as a child i ended up creating a dependance on fast food and games which made me obese at a very young age, this of course left me with an appearance that made it difficult to make friends which impacted how i act socially to this day, i got bullied and neglected by society to the point where even people that got involved would be called disgusting and would also be misstreated. I ended up making a friend, a black kid which i really liked, he treated me nicely even if people saw him as someone disgusting because of me, he ended up going to  a school in Angola, Africa after a year which made me say my first ever goodbye at 5 years of age.

Troughout my 4 years in primary school i managed to make 3 friends, 1 of them was a bit more distant ehile the other 2 had the same interests, i got to know these 2 specifically when the game Five Night's at Freddy's released and, altough i was happy when i was with them i always felt my life didn't ""have color"" to the point i literally started being unable to see color in things like the blue sky (which i perceived as a less-glowing blue) and most colors at the time felt ""greyish"" to me, not sure if there's something cientific related, if so please let me know as i would like to understand a bit more about myself.
The bullying continued as usual, kids would sometimes spit on me, i couldn't go to the cantheen or people would throw food at me so i started having lunch at home, got my front teeth broken and removed because of a kid who punched me, was minding my own business and got pushed from a very high place which traumatized me and now i can't be on high places with people behind me,  while everyone had their notebooks handed to them mine would be thrown at the desk in a way to avoid contact with both the notebook and me.

My grandpa (which was my father figure all my life) died when i was 7 which made me feel numbness, it also made me aggressive and i had to go to a psychologist.

Starting my 5th year it got even worse since my mother separated from my father, i didn't have any friends, people took advantage of me asking me for money falsely promissing to be friends with me only to ignore me each chance they had unless i had money to give them.
People from my class would constantly pinch me and make fun of my mom and wanted to switch schools.

6th grade was when i finally regained the ""color"" in my life and i finally made true friends that still are in my life today and are very important to me, they stick with me trough my lows but i don't have the courage to spill everything that goes on my mind cause i don't wanna be a bother to them even tho i am very talkative and get criticized for it a lot.

2020 was the best year in my life since i was able to lose weight and be happy with myself, i ran faster than ever and felt an adrenaline i didn't know was even possible, this i'm sure was the last time in my life i ever felt true honest happiness.

On 9th grade however i got into a severe depression which made me miss 6 months of school, get to 110kg and almost lose my friends, this impacted me completely and it's by far the worst year in my Life.

In highschool only one of my friends stayed in the same school as me and i still felt depressed altough i felt like i was getting better, i also had something that adults called ""sad eyes"" at the time, at that time my eyes were naturally dead so to say, i baaically had the face of someone who didn't care about life or anything in general, still i saw that people cared about me so i did an effort in order to change and to this day i forcefully create a normal look even tho i still have that face when i'm alone (i'm like that right now in case you're curious).

I made an effort and ended up losing 30 pounds which landed me on 80KG, i later got to 70 which is the ""normal"" weight for my height.

I finished Highschool, graduated now i'm here.


What i realised about mu life and how i feel nowadays:

What i came here to talk about mainly is how i feel like, after reaching adulthood, i realised that i had depression for my entire life and not just after 9th grade.

I have everything to be happy, good friends, a mom that cares and supports me in everything she can, an appartment that i will inherit, i'm good at music and have a thing called ""perfect pitch"" which is almost a cheat code, i don't suffer from any finantial problems and have everything i always want even if it takes time.

Altough it might sound bad, i hate myself and i simply can't live with myself, i see what i am and it feels me with disgust and sadness seeing how if someone else was chosen they would be way better than me at just living life and just enjoying the life i have to the fullest.
I constantly think of being killed as i honestly don't have the courage to kill myself, i don't know if any of the emotions i ever felt besides sadness and numbness were even real, i'm currently having difficulties feeling and even smiling at my friends, when i laugh i'm always conscious and it feels like i'm just faking it even tho i'm not.

I'm just having trouble understanding if what i feel is even true at this point, if i can even feel emotions with 100% honesty and not only it makes my head hurt it keeps me awake at night, i'm just a 19 year old guy, i don't know what i'm doing and even if i'm emotionally stable and this is normal since everyone deals with their own shit and most of them doesn't like to tell, also, i find it easier to live life when i erase emotions completely since i stop feeling fear.

Just came here to talk about this cause i'm starting to recover some memories, good and bad, and i also want to know if it's worth it seeing a therapist or this is just stupidity of me or i am being childish.

If you read this, sorry for taking your time and thanks for your attention.

If you are going trough ghe same experience as me feel free to share since i have lots of time and do nothing with it.

My depression destroyed everything,"I love her. I love her more than anything in the world. The three years we have spent together I’ve felt safe, loved, comforted, and cared about. We had our issues, and we both hurt each other, but shes never left my mind as the most beautiful perfect shining light in this world and my motivation to secure a good life for not just myself but the both of us. I transitioned very early into our relationship, because no one had ever made me feel so comfortable and confident to be myself, and shes helped me every step of the way.  

All of this, and my stupid piece of shit brain still wants me to die. It never ends. I should be so fucking happy, I AM so happy because I have everything I could realistically want. My stupid fucking brain demoralizes me and sets me back, and made me neglect her and lash out and not be the partner she deserved. I know I’m that girl. She’s my fucking treasure and I’ve seen her grow so much over our relationship and all of my goals in life have her in it. But it’s too late. I’ve stomped on and ruined her heart, and I didn’t even want to. Everything making me hate myself just made her want to move on. I had a chance to move us to Colorado, we could see all the metal shows we miss out on, make more money, find fellowship in community, experience the world, go to the cool bars and try all sorts of new food, in a state with growth and career opportunities for both of us. I know it would have been perfect but she’s only seen me rot and can’t trust me to make her happy. I understand it completely but it hurts so bad that this disease in my brain fucked up all I’ve ever wanted.",depression,,Colorado,38.7251776,-105.607716
Reddit and Politic/the News has wrecked my self-esteem and mental health,"Over the past 3 months, my self-esteem has completely collapsed—and I think a huge part of it is because of Reddit, Instagram, and the kinds of content I’ve been exposed to.

I’m visibly brown, Muslim, and of Pakistani ancestry. Before these past few months, I had insecurities here and there, sure—but I didn’t hate myself. I didn’t see myself as fundamentally lesser or unwelcome in the world, and I didn't feel inferior because of a lack of Caucasian-looking features. But after consuming so many comments, posts, videos, and discussions online, something has shifted in me in a really dark and painful way.

I now feel like I’m hated *everywhere* in the world —that no country, no community, no culture will ever fully accept me. My birthplace (Canada) has no career path for me in Aerospace (having a profession that's exclusive to a few countries doesn't help). My ancestral country doesn’t align with my values or have a future for me. And in the countries I really do love and check all of my boxes—like those in Europe—I’m convinced I’ll always be treated like an outsider or merely tolerated at best in the name of anti-racism etc until I'm not (and recent events in the US have made me realize how quickly the world can turn on you). These feelings and beliefs have become deeply ingrained into my psyche after seeing news content, YouTube influencer videos, and Reddit posts/comments which seem to confirm what I've said above.

Every comment I read online about Muslims, brown people, or Pakistanis really hurts and cuts a little deeper. I know I shouldn't internalize them, ignore it, etc but I can’t help it anymore. The hate feels real. The isolation feels permanent. I never felt this way in my life, but it's gotten to the point where I now have caught myself tacitly assuming people I meet in real life secretly dislike me or look down on me because of my background or appearance. That assumption is slowly poisoning my relationships, my confidence, and how I move through the world.

It’s also completely shattered my confidence in my appearance as a woman. I grew up in a Western country and I honestly never felt “ugly” or undesirable before because of my looks. But recently, I’ve found myself obsessing over not having Caucasian features—my face, skin tone, bone structure. I’ve started to think I look too “generic brown” to be liked, while wishing I had more Caucasian-looking features. 

A large chunk of the reason being because of all the negative stereotypes, comments, peoples beliefs, etc that I've read about people from my background or religion. My appearance clearly identifies my identity, and in turn everything I've read that confirms people like me are despised everywhere makes me hate my appearance. It’s made me pull back from forming friendships, expressing ideas at school or work, and it’s even made me feel like love and marriage are out of reach for someone like me.

On top of that, even when people are nice to me, I feel this intense paranoia that the second we disagree on anything or a cultural difference shows up—they’ll turn on me. Like the kindness is conditional, only ever temporary, or sort of in a ""forced"" tolerance/politeness kind of way.

A lot of what I feel seems confirmed by reality. I hate being intellectually dishonest or telling myself comforting lies, because it's a bandaid and doesn't address the real problems. When I look at the rise of anti-Muslim/anti-Brown politicians and rhetoric sweeping European elections, or just vitriol towards my religion/people of my appearance consistently topping every reddit post I look at, it confirms my beliefs as the truth and that's why it affects how I see the real world too. 

I never used to think this way. Reddit and the internet have warped my perception so much that I barely recognize how I see myself anymore. It feels like my identity has become a curse and it's changed my beliefs about myself and how I've viewed dramatically.

I guess… I just desperately want to feel welcomed somewhere. Like I can belong as my full self, with all of my identity. I don’t know how to get that back, if I can ever even do so.

Has anyone else gone through this? Have you felt your self-worth destroyed by online exposure or social media? Does this go away or have I poisoned myself in this way permanently?

These feelings really really suck and I really don't want to feel like this or be in this position anymore.

TLDR: Negative comments/hate about aspects of my identity as well as following global/world news and politics have demolished my self-esteem:

A) making me feel hated that my brown appearance ties me to negative/hateful stereotypes, and B) making me feel that the majority of the people in the world hate me and that no country in the world can ever be home.",depression,,Canada,61.0666922,-107.991707

Unhappy and stuck in my family and area,"(28M) I’m autistic (high-functioning) and have OCD and depression, with undiagnosed anxiety. I’ve had a long, hard road socially and developmentally. I’m relatively lean and think I look decent, but I never got more than a short fling when I was 21 (ironically when I looked much worse). No relationships. I’ve been in college for a long time (now online) and have had to work full-time. The worst part is that I live in a small town in a southern state and can’t yet afford to move out from my grandmother’s house. She’s so obsessed with religion and expects me to be enthusiastically religious with her, despite me never praying or showing interest in attending church. Thankfully, I’m making quick progress with my program and anticipate finishing this summer, so I’ll be able to leave this dreadful region for a large northeastern city this fall. But I still feel so down. So many people my age have had great relationships, numerous vacations, and great jobs. And so many people on Reddit seem to live in advanced, liberal US cities. It’s unfair because it’s easier to afford to live in such cities if you start in them like all these people do. And my family always disregards my feelings about this area and what I want in life (no kids, to live in a large northeastern city). And there’s no way to make friends here, it’s very clique-based.

So I’m behind on social life, dating, and living in an acceptable locale of the US. And I’m more or less stuck with a backward family. Will life get better for me when I move to a large northeastern city? Obviously it won’t automatically fix itself by me moving there. But there are so many ways to meet cool people who I share interests with in those cities, not everyone is married by 24, there’s a diverse job market, and there’s an endless array of things to see and do there.

Ectopic pregnancy and Disney…,"This is gonna probably seem bratty but it’s bothering me. In September I had to have emergency surgery to remove an ectopic pregnancy in my left fallopian tube. We had planned a vacation to Panama City beach, FL.  2 days later we left for the beach… I was tired and sore, but I was excited as the pregnancy news came as a surprise(I only found out 5hrs before surgery and was bleeding internally) and I didn’t have time to process anything. While we were there I got excited and thought of the idea to go to Disney World (happiest place on earth, right?) I looked it up and it was gonna be about $600 to go for a day and get a room to stay in. It was a 6hr drive there and honestly, just wanted to eat a Mickey bar in front of the castle wearing some ears and maybe ride the small world ride. That is literally all I wanted out of that. It was a little thing that I thought would make me happy. I talked it over with my husband and I wanted to go so bad but I didn’t want to spend all that money for a day and he didn’t want to drive the 6hrs. He reminded me we said we would go in February for a week and it was okay to not go for a day just after surgery. Fast forward to now… we don’t have the money to go anymore and I didn’t get that day… I keep trying to tell myself it’s stupid and it’s expensive but in reality I was really excited and kinda heartbroken over it. It was the part I wanted out of the trip and we had originally planned to go to both but changed at last minute and we’re gonna go in February for a week instead . I hate sand but love the sound of the ocean and I had fun but I was exhausted. I was sore and walking through the sand was annoying and hard. I’m not mad we can’t go I’m just upset over it. My family (husband and daughter) enjoy the beach. Don’t get me wrong I had fun and I’m thankful for the time but I just feel kinda robbed… that was a lot all at once to process and I didn’t get that day and now I don’t get to go at all. He said we could go next year but I’m not holding my breath for it because it is just getting more and more expensive. I don’t know… I feel like a brat because many don’t get to even do that..I just am sad over it. I also have had another surgery since then to remove my other fallopian tube and I’ve been kinda a wreck. It was never that I didn’t want more kids…it was that pregnancy was hard and my mental health got worse after my daughter and I was diagnosed as bipolar with depression and anxiety. I think I mostly did it so that would never happen again. I was terrified of getting pregnant again and it happened and I couldn’t process it or even make the decision for myself what we would do… it was all decided for me in a matter of hours.

Final Try,"Second attempt because my first one got taken down. i just wanted to reach out.

15M. I don’t deserve anybody, i don’t deserve you reading this. It’s horrible when i resort to something like this just for someone to listen to me. I hate myself. Ever since the 5th grade when i failed for the first time. I’m 6th grad ei started getting bullied for the way i look, in 7th my grades only kept declining and i had basically nobody. I finally made a couple friends nearing the end of the year, but one of them couldn’t go a day without commenting on my appearance for cheap jokes. I had to ask him to please stop, and he didn’t get why it affected me so much. I got my first crush the next year. Although, i had started liking her for a while before that, i just never had thought of her like that. I think i stopped myself. But even though he knew, he knew i liked her, he started liking her too. He liked her way after i did. He didn’t care. He announced it on Christmas day to the entire friend group. He ruined my Christmas that year. I hated him. I hated him. I couldn’t look him in the eye, so i tried to stop talking to him. It was so hard to avoid him because i saw him everyday, and he never understood what he did wrong. I eventually forced myself to forgive him after a couple months. I felt like i was hurting myself more if i tried not to. My self-image has never recovered since those events. The bullying persists and nothing gets better. He eventually broke up with her. And got with a girl a couple months after. And eventually they actually both helped me get a girlfriend. Although he tried rushing us and almost sabotaged us. He was still confused, said he was just trying to help. She broke up with me two weeks later, because she said she was desperate for a boyfriend so she picked me. I didn’t cry. I didn’t cry, because i can’t. I can never cry and i don’t know why i can’t. I didn’t cry when my family member died, i didn’t cry when i hurt myself for the first time, and i didn’t cry when she broke up with me. A couple months before this though, i had gotten extremely close to one of my friends. I’ll use “G” to refer to him. And i felt like he was the only one i could trust. I remember he started hanging out with this one friend i never heard of, i’ll use “D” to refer to him. I noticed he was spending a lot of time with him. I got kind of nervous. I was scared he would leave me. I was scared he would abandon me. I began to resent D for it. I hated him and made it clear i did whenever he joined call or something. He didn’t go to our school. It wasn’t until i had a long late night conversation with him one day (and i learned he was actually a childhood friend of G), that i realized i was being stupid. As time went on, i became close with him too. They were really my only friends i felt like cared about me. I even began to get over my ex. I started to notice this one girl in my class and it helped me take my mind off of the bad things. Like me failing. Or past experiences. I didn’t know her that well. I wanted to be her friend. But he had to ruin it. The boy that ruined my life. I never gave him a name. “J”. I’ll use that. He talked to her. He made her panic and she admitted that she would never date me. He ruined something before it ever even started. I hate him. It was the last straw. I couldn’t believe it. He didn’t see what he did wrong. He never does. I hate him. He made me hate myself. He made me feel worthless. He made me hurt myself. I hate him. He broke up with his second girlfriend because he felt like he never liked her like that. So he realizes that after nine months of dating her. I felt so bad for her. He doesn’t care about people’s feelings. He cares about himself, and he will never feel the consequences of his actions. But i feel the consequences of being alive. I lost my ability to cry. I lost my ability to sleep. I keep myself up by replaying everything that happened and blaming myself. I hate it. I fall asleep in class. I fail school. When my body forces me to sleep i dream horrible dreams. The one i remember the most is one where i saw the whole world die. My friends G and D died horribly. My family died horribly. I saw billions of people die and it was all my fault. All i could do was scream. I don’t deserve anything anymore. I know my parents care but i don’t feel it.

I want to be hated so when i leave i won’t have a remaining memory. I want to be forgotten. I started talking to J’s ex because she came into contact with me so we could share our horrible experiences with him.  we called every single day since then. I never thought of her that way until i dreamt about her. I hated myself for it. I never deserved to think of her romantically. But apparently after a month or two of talking, she cared about me a lot. She was telling me how much she cared about me and that i was her favorite person. It made me cry. It didn’t hurt to cry that day. They didn’t burn. I confessed to her after that. She said she liked me too, but wanted to wait after all the past experiences. I get it, i went through a bad ex not too long ago too. I wish i never confessed. I wish i never did. I ruined everything when i did. She likes me too. But she doesn’t think she’s in the right mental to get into a relationship. But she got a boyfriend. She got with the boy i helped her get over. Why can’t i have anything.

I can’t open up to my parents. I went to the doctor. they forced a therapist on me. Even if i don’t, my teachers will tell on me. Now i need medication. I want to be normal. i don’t know why i’m typing anymore. Nobody will care to read. Nobody will care to help. Nobody could help me anymore. I want someone to love me. I just want love.

Final Try,"Second attempt because my first one got taken down. i just wanted to reach out.

15M. I don’t deserve anybody, i don’t deserve you reading this. It’s horrible when i resort to something like this just for someone to listen to me. I hate myself. Ever since the 5th grade when i failed for the first time. I’m 6th grad ei started getting bullied for the way i look, in 7th my grades only kept declining and i had basically nobody. I finally made a couple friends nearing the end of the year, but one of them couldn’t go a day without commenting on my appearance for cheap jokes. I had to ask him to please stop, and he didn’t get why it affected me so much. I got my first crush the next year. Although, i had started liking her for a while before that, i just never had thought of her like that. I think i stopped myself. But even though he knew, he knew i liked her, he started liking her too. He liked her way after i did. He didn’t care. He announced it on Christmas day to the entire friend group. He ruined my Christmas that year. I hated him. I hated him. I couldn’t look him in the eye, so i tried to stop talking to him. It was so hard to avoid him because i saw him everyday, and he never understood what he did wrong. I eventually forced myself to forgive him after a couple months. I felt like i was hurting myself more if i tried not to. My self-image has never recovered since those events. The bullying persists and nothing gets better. He eventually broke up with her. And got with a girl a couple months after. And eventually they actually both helped me get a girlfriend. Although he tried rushing us and almost sabotaged us. He was still confused, said he was just trying to help. She broke up with me two weeks later, because she said she was desperate for a boyfriend so she picked me. I didn’t cry. I didn’t cry, because i can’t. I can never cry and i don’t know why i can’t. I didn’t cry when my family member died, i didn’t cry when i hurt myself for the first time, and i didn’t cry when she broke up with me. A couple months before this though, i had gotten extremely close to one of my friends. I’ll use “G” to refer to him. And i felt like he was the only one i could trust. I remember he started hanging out with this one friend i never heard of, i’ll use “D” to refer to him. I noticed he was spending a lot of time with him. I got kind of nervous. I was scared he would leave me. I was scared he would abandon me. I began to resent D for it. I hated him and made it clear i did whenever he joined call or something. He didn’t go to our school. It wasn’t until i had a long late night conversation with him one day (and i learned he was actually a childhood friend of G), that i realized i was being stupid. As time went on, i became close with him too. They were really my only friends i felt like cared about me. I even began to get over my ex. I started to notice this one girl in my class and it helped me take my mind off of the bad things. Like me failing. Or past experiences. I didn’t know her that well. I wanted to be her friend. But he had to ruin it. The boy that ruined my life. I never gave him a name. “J”. I’ll use that. He talked to her. He made her panic and she admitted that she would never date me. He ruined something before it ever even started. I hate him. It was the last straw. I couldn’t believe it. He didn’t see what he did wrong. He never does. I hate him. He made me hate myself. He made me feel worthless. He made me hurt myself. I hate him. He broke up with his second girlfriend because he felt like he never liked her like that. So he realizes that after nine months of dating her. I felt so bad for her. He doesn’t care about people’s feelings. He cares about himself, and he will never feel the consequences of his actions. But i feel the consequences of being alive. I lost my ability to cry. I lost my ability to sleep. I keep myself up by replaying everything that happened and blaming myself. I hate it. I fall asleep in class. I fail school. When my body forces me to sleep i dream horrible dreams. The one i remember the most is one where i saw the whole world die. My friends G and D died horribly. My family died horribly. I saw billions of people die and it was all my fault. All i could do was scream. I don’t deserve anything anymore. I know my parents care but i don’t feel it. They have such a i love you mentality that they hate me. I hate everything. I push away the last people that care about me. G and D. I’m pushing them away. I want them to hate me. I want to be hated so when i leave i won’t have a remaining memory. I want to be forgotten.

I’m so sad,"Hello, 17 live in Va and have been going through a very rough two months. I quit high school two years ago because I have crippling social anxiety and have been carrying instant gratifying habits for a while now. I recently started talking to a girl and I’ve learned I’m more of an overthinker than I was aware of. I get obsessed way too fast, and then unbeknownst to them I give them full access to my thoughts and feelings having them live in my head rent free. Things were going well for a month, and then It just died out and received mixed signals, for a time it was the happiest I’d been in my life. So now Ive turned into an avoidant out of self preservation and now I feel like an asshole for taking hours to reply to them, always have been to a certain extent with my peers but wasn’t expecting it to be this way with this person. The limerance is real… So I get in these states of just utter sadness and hopelessness and I start having suicidal thoughts basically thinking I’m not good enough and have no motivation to do anything. I think I’ve been cursed, maybe I did this to myself, Idk maybe I’m autistic but I do know my self esteem has been low since middle school and never feel comfortable in my own skin unless I’m in a solitary environment or on a walk at 3:00 am at night. I have no desire to socialize with people and am not ready for a relationship let alone friendships because I don’t love myself, I’m emotionally mature and a good person never put others down and am very nice to everyone I meet but feel like that just hurts me more in the end when I give people my all. When I get in these states I just can’t self regulate, I sit in the sadness and just don’t want to feel this pain in my heart. I have people to talk to but it doesn’t help, it’s not going to change my thought process. So I don’t know why I came on here to vent, this is the equivalent of writing smth in notes app since it’s really just a long paragraph of self pity and not at all open ended. I don’t know maybe other people can relate I’m sorry not trying to make myself a burden for anyone I’m my own responsibility but tips on how to get better and stop caring would be helpful I hear meditating is good, finding hobbies, and how do I get the motivation to do these things.",depression,,Va,41.903411,12.4528527
I give up,"Hey

22f here

I have depression , bpd , ptsd & autism.
I stopped school because of a beginning burn out. I can finally say I'm in the right therapy for that. Its focused on bpd habits. 

Now I've been struggling with health problems. I lost 40kgs in 8months because of it. For 7-8months they saw ptsd & bpd ...and they thought it was stress. Now I've been to the er last weekend. Also saw bpd & thought stress. Now I did an echo and bloodwork. My gallbladder has stones, my pancreas and liver aren't good. And they think I have mcas. I haven't eating in 5days because if I eat...I get very sick. I live on aquarius and the fortimel drinks. 
I'm so traumatized by getting sick because of food. Now they told me its probably forever. I wanna give up. I dont wanna have this pain forever. I think I'm kms soon. I give up. This isn't the life I want. This isn't the life my partner deserves. I'm sure my partner will find a healthy geeky girl that isn't a fuck up like me. My parents dont really care they abused me for years. I don't really have close friends. Friends that you see a few times a year . I won't be missed. I won't be in pain anymore. Maybe In another lifetime I wont be this sick in the head & body. 

Sounds very pessimistic ..i know...
But everytime something new happends. I know thats life. But I dont want that life. I tried , I really did try. But I dont enjoy anything anymore in life. All I do is complain. All I do is cry and be angry. I became my mom lol. I cant do a household bcs of not getting food in my system, I cant work out, I cant eat , I dont make my parents or partner happy, im a burden...and the guilt is so high, I cant work bcs of mental health, I cant keep friends/ relationships, I'm a fuck up. 
I don't bring joy to my loved ones. I dont even bring joy to myself. So why would I live on? ",depression,,bpd,-23.53777205,-46.73598396295546

On reprieve...,"Hello everyone,

I'm going to post something not very original to you.  I am a 28 year old French man, homosexual. I'm in the middle of depression. I have always been very negative but now I am hitting rock bottom. 

I have a job, a place to live, a little money aside, I have nothing to complain about, but happiness is not there.

I am deeply alone. My life has no meaning. Very few friends, no lovers.  I tried dating apps but it doesn't work, the relationships are quite superficial. 

I want to write goodbye letters. What’s stopping me from taking action are my mom and my sister… I lost my dad to cancer 5 years ago, it’s going to be very difficult for my mom. I couldn't think about ending my life while my dad was sick, then I put it off because of my sister's marriage, then the birth of my niece. We have a family trip at the end of April/beginning of May. After this trip I have no plans this year and I think this will be the ideal time to think about that.  

I don't want to be selfish and only think about myself, but if you only knew how deep my pain is. Weekends, evenings, vacations are my obsession. Too much time for me... eating alone, living alone, an empty apartment, a round table and 4 chairs that are often empty, a set of 12 plates and cutlery that I never use... I rarely take time off because I don't know what to do with all this time alone and it terrifies me. 

I'm 28 years old and I don't dare imagine living the next 20, 30, 40 years like this. Fed up with this routine, waking up, eating, working, sleeping, shopping, cleaning. For whom? Why do all this? 

I am learning about the different ways of dying. I would like not to fail, I don't want to find myself in the hospital, chained to a bed and be followed by people for life. 

I went to see a psychologist last year for 2 months, every week. It was nice to talk to someone from outside without fear, but I realized that I was spending money for nothing :/

Forgive me dear network for this lack of originality and these many lines.

"Young Adult, struggles with motivation, driving, S.I","Half vent, half looking for advice rn

I (18F) am almost done with my senior year of HS and for whatever reason I’m terrified of driving - I know have to do it/learn, I tell myself it’s because I have no motivation and I’m terrified bc of my own overthinking and S.I- I’m in therapy but I started before I was 18 so I didn’t share my S.I thoughts - I realize I probably should and I’ve only told my partner about it (17, almost 18 Non-Binary). I’ve told them about most of those problems but I feel like unless I come right out and say it they just think I’m venting and not that I’m spiraling or overthinking or struggling with S.I and other thoughts..

The main problems that I feel have been a part of my depression have been loneliness, overthinking, people pleasing those who don’t love me (ex: feeling ignored in my band class by band mates even when I’ve tried to help/often advice to younger members, over gets overlooked for other seniors or those who are better players).

Is it ok/valid that I’ve been struggling with learning/wanting to drive and motivation after feeling ignored by those I love? Should I force myself to drive to do other stuff even if I’m terrified of messing up or overthinking or being so worried that I spiral and lose focus and then something bad does happen-",depression,,S.I,41.95920355,12.466086994620502

Being depressed and having depression are different.,"I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. 

I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life. 


Anyway, that’s all. I’m sure no one will even read this. K bye

"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive","Hi y’all,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.
It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.
I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway.",depression,,France,46.603354,1.8883335
"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive","Hi y’all,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans.

"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive","Hi y’all,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.
It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.

I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.
I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway.",depression,,I‘m,48.8625813,2.3818378

Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family.

I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive.

 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.",depression,,Miami,25.7741728,-80.19362
Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now.,"Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. 


Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. 


I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. 



 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now.,"Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. 


Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. 


I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. 



 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach.

While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Thanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.

Is it alright if I vent? No one here cares...,"I’m a 50 year old man who is married and has raised two successful daughters. Sounds great, right? I’ve been diagnosed with RA, OA, CPS, Fibromyalgia, neuropathy, PTSD, osteopenia, high blood pressure, anxiety, severe depression, degenerative joint and disc, and a few others. I’m not looking for sympathy, just setting the stage. 
My wife of 22 years was present for each diagnoses, as well as my younger daughter. She promised it would be okay when I gave her a chance to get out and find a better man. I worked 14 to 16 hour days for 27 years trying to do what we needed done. Now, she says I’m lying about the problems. I’m on disability and can barely walk. She calls me lazy and stupid for not working when I really miss being productive. When my problems flare up and I can’t do things, she gets mad. She has now taken $900 that is mine. I’m at a loss. My wife was a wonderful woman. I don’t understand. There are days that I’m tempted to let the depression win and end my life because I don’t want to live like this. I’m done. I apologize for doing this here. I have nowhere else to do this. If you read this, God bless you and thank you. You treat me better than my family.


I never thought people would pay attention to this, but you did. Thank you. I fell asleep last night trying to reply to every one of you, but I see now that there’s a lot. Thank you so much. You’ve all given me some things to consider.

Thank you, each and every one of you. I never dreamed I would even get a reply. I just thought it would be like it is at home. Thank you. You’ve made a grown man cry. This means a lot.",depression,,OA,-34.6015521,-58.3713256
Casually Suicidal,"Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death? You think about the consequences of it and what people's views are on it. Maybe you have even considered suicide. You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don’t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don’t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can’t call myself depressed, because I’m not sad all the time. I can’t say I have anxiety, because I’m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don’t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I’m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don’t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on. I’m just feeling like this, that’s all.

For all the comments, I'm sorry I can't reply to them all but I will try to when I get round to it. But I want to say this now for anyone who will be reading in the future, please feel free to pm me. I'll always reply. Didn't realise this would blow up, but it is nice to know people feel the same way. I hope you find some sort of comfort in that as I do. Stay safe.

"Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone. It's long and I apologise for the length","Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice

I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.

My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a ""perfect"" ""son"" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.

As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.

My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. 

I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over ""no one really cares about you"" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships

But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem

All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. ""No one really cares"" 

I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult 

I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive",depression,,Arizona,34.395342,-111.763275

I’m always amazed at how much energy healthy people have.,"When I wake up after 8 hours of decent sleep I’m still exhausted. All day, everyday. Not just “tired”. Exhausted.

“Exercise helps!” yeah I’m sure it does but I can’t even get out of bed.

“Drink water and eat healthy!” again, I can’t even get out of bed. 

I’m guessing the next thing would be “you just have to use self discipline and force yourself to do it!” but...how? It feels as though I physically can’t.

I am currently experiencing the worst my depression has ever been. It’s really difficult to say the least.

I’m genuinely surprised I’m still here. It sounds wrong but I do feel kinda badass that I’ve managed to hold on so far...and so should you. We survived yesterday, so why not do it again today?",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908

I don’t “dream” to be an engineer, or an astronaut, or anything. 

I just want to pet my therapy dog, smoke my medical weed for my chronic pain, go tanning, read, watch Netflix, sing.

We only see those who get better,"Aka survivorship bias. We hear the stories of the people whose mental illness got better, but there’s little acknowledgement of those who have only gone downhill. I’m tired of hearing “It will get better, just look at what happened to me!” Because it hasn’t. Why should I continue suffering for the lofty hope that my depression will ease up? I call it as I see it. If my mental state has deteriorated, even after years of treatment, then I probably won’t end up as a survivor.",depression,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
I miss the old me,"I’ve forgotten what genuine and pure happiness actually feels like. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to actually have a passion for life. These last few months have been a blur, I can only really recall a few days in detail. I miss the old me, she had so much potential. She had so many friends, she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed, she looked healthy  and prettier. Now I can’t even move out of bed. I just lie there waiting for someone to text me, but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or I’ve pushed them away. I don’t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch Netflix now. My housemates don’t even notice when I don’t leave my room for a week. Even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery. I used to be so full of life, but that seems like an eternity away, such a distant memory now. It feels like I have no one now and I have no energy to even move, let alone do anything slightly productive.

I think acting depressed around people was a mistake,"No one gives a shit lmao. Unless you have a very special person who's very close to you, whoever notices you're acting off will not want to help, because you're not fun to be around, and in the end you'll just lose connections.

Truth is, you're way better off if you force a smile on your face. If I had known this before, I feel like I might have had more and better relations with people that I would have liked.

Don't get me wrong, I think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves. But it's just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since that's just gonna insure that no one's ever gonna talk to you, its a terrible alternative. So ""give in"" if you want to help yourself.

EDIT: okay, I was wrong. I really should not have gotten this many upvotes. I know no one is gonna see this since I'm editing after like a month, but I was wrong. 

Talking to people helps so, so much. Its just, you gotta find the right people, or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression. Its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships, and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that.

 But I just want to say, don't bottle up your feelings forever. Do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this. Often forcing a smile helps for this. But dont do this forever.",depression,,Truth,51.4908534,-0.22390478617004028

life is a chore,"Having to wake up and immediately being struck with this shock of *I have to do this all over again.* Have to go to school, college, university or even work, we're stuck in our imaginative sociable, unsociable life. There are no questions to our daily duties, as we're following the propaganda of what others expect us to be. 

Just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species. We all supposedly ""have a purpose"" to fill, but what if you don't fit that category? Where do we go from there?

In my situation, I personally think I am not fit for this world. I suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health. Similarly, my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything. I have no one personal and close that can fully understand my situation. I lost the one person I loved deeply and now she is with someone else. There's nothing and no one left to live for.

I know that my parents will just say that depression and suicidal thoughts are just common and focus on my grade and GPA. I feel hopeless. I want to know where to take my  life from. No comfort or support will help me much. I feel like I’m better off gone than having to work more and study and prepare for school and the SAT. To me that is all there is to life. I’m sorry mom and dad. Even though I spent time with you I simply can’t get over it. Goodbye and I love you because this is not your fault. Thank you for all the memories and support you have me for the past seventeen years of my life. The times when you scolded me that if I didn’t get a good SAT score, then I would be sent to academies and my dog would be sent back to its previous home.

Therapy just made me more aware of how isolated I feel because most people suck at empathy,"I’ve been in therapy for years. In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.

Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me

"I can't deal with it anymore, I'm ending my life.","I'm 20 Female from the Philippines.
My Cousin attempted to raped me last month.
My Dad knew about it and kick him out of the house, But now my cousin is back and welcomed by my Dad with open arms.

They expect me to just forget about what happened just get on with life.

I can't sleep, I can barely eat, past rape trauma flooding my mind like a storm. How can I forget, how can I forget that easily when everyday I feel scared and disgusted about myself.

My Dad doesn't really care about me, He doesn't gave me allowance or support me in school. Can't even buy me clothes or other things I need all are hand me downs.

My phone recently broke it's a hand me down from my aunt 4 yrs ago, I tried to get it fixed but I was told by the technician that it's better the I buy a new one.

Asked my Dad if he could buy me one he scolded telling me how clumsy I am, ungrateful and doesn't settle on what was given to me, he even goes on to hit me.

I suffered a black eye but other than bruises I'm good. 

I'm doing my best to get to college and get a scholarship but with recent events it's getting harder and harder I can barely catch up with my online studies, because I need to ration the remaining allowance I have from being a part time Make up artist.

Wish me luck. Voluntarily committing myself to hospital for severe depression.,"Hey, guys. I’ve been a long time lurker here but never actually posted. I don’t think I’m even looking for advice, just wanted to tell somebody what’s going on because my agoraphobia has gotten to the point where I’m literally too scared to speak to my family or friends. 

Right now I’m charging my phone in my car before I voluntarily commit myself to a hospital in Florida where I live. It’s gotten to the point that im so depressed and exhausted that I literally can’t do anything. I can’t take care of myself. I can’t even make myself eat three meals a day much less one. I can’t make myself shower daily. The only time I fully wake myself up out of sleep is to go to work where I drag my feet for eight hours until I can clock out and sleep some more. I can’t take care of my child, when I’m off work I either put on kids shows on tv for him or leave him with the babysitter because she can take better care of him than I. I can’t take care of my husband, he’s tired of me being barely a person. Please just wish me luck and cross your fingers that this helps me. Love you all.",depression,,Florida,27.7567667,-81.4639835

Morning Job giving me 2 extra days off so I can get more rest. Been losing sleep 5 days/ week.,"I have picked up my first part time job back in November. I work mornings 5/ days a week unless schedule changes since it follows the school calendar. 

I always been coming into work tired in morning cause my full time job would end at 11PM and I’ll be home almost midnight and have to settle down and be in bed by 1:30am. Sometimes my body pushes it past 2am and I wake up feeling eyes flicker. I know my loss of sleep had my anxiety going. 

The past week I was feeling drowsy and 1 day I didn’t fall asleep in time did a build affect till next day and the next when I had to work mornings. I had to reschedule my appointments to afternoon cause of my morning job. Since last week I came into work late cause my body felt dead tired and sleepy for few days. I even slept 9 hours on Saturday night and still felt drowsy but bit better. 

I now got approved to have 2 extra days cause I told them I worry for my heart health and I can’t get enough rest. I still needed extra side money and so I wanted to still be employed so I’m down to 3 days/ week with my morning job.

But when I got hit with panic attack in January I went to ER and heart rate was high and I was dehydrated. ( I always drank caffeine and fried foods+ pastas/ red meats) 

They told me i had sinus Trachycardia and I heard it was normal everyone has it and doesn’t realize feeling but now after having health anxiety and this. I feel chest flutters and stinging pain and arm weakness. I had to email my cardiologist times before and she had to reassure me it has nothing to do with cardiac arrest and less likelihood of me getting one. 

I have had high triglycerides and LDL and I was told to cut out certain foods and I was trying to research what I could change or take to help with my LDL. I have lost about 25-30lbs since my hospital visits. 

All I could think about is will I be okay and this pain to stop and I don’t have to feel it everyday but anxiety will take over some moments and for my heart health. ",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
Feeling off after starting magnesium glycinate + L-theanine,"I used to be on a bunch of prescribed meds—Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, and Wellbutrin (which I was on the longest). I hated how they made me feel, and I stopped years ago after my psychiatrist agreed we could try going off them.

Since then, I’ve mostly managed stress with ashwagandha, especially to help with sleep. But I think I’ve developed a tolerance to it, so I started looking into new supplements. After doing some research, I bought magnesium glycinate (160mg) to take before bed and L-theanine for daytime use, both from Sports Research.

But now I’m a little freaked out. After just a couple days of taking them, I’m starting to feel eerily similar to how I felt on my old meds. Yesterday, I was just standing there when I got this awful migraine, couldn’t open my eyes, and then immediately passed out when I tried to lie down. I also couldn’t sleep for a bit last night and ended up taking two doses of magnesium and was still not helping.

Do you think this is a reaction to the supplements? Or is it just my anxiety acting up again and maybe I do need to go back on meds?",anxiety,,Prozac,25.024109,121.5436003
Random bouts of anxiety?,"Hello, everyone. 

I've been officially diagnosed with GAD and PD last year, after a very intense anxiety-filled summer. I've always been anxious, but it has progressively gotten worse - until I seeked help. I was put on 40 mg Prozac and have also started 50 mg Trazodone (for sleeping issues). 

The thing is.. I still feel anxious, almost every single day. It's like I'm anxious about something unknown, I get this feeling of impending doom, like something is about to happen. But I.. don't think about anything. There's literally nothing in my brain, it's just a physical feeling. I get nauseous, feeling like I'm about to pass out, scared that I'll have a panic attack - so I just pretty much throw myself into one.

This usually happens when I'm home (in a safe environment), and usually at night. Like I just.. don't get it. I don't even know what to do about it, because I don't get why it's happening. But it has been happening almost every day for a while now.",anxiety,,PD,45.391408,11.805848677115883
When I think my anxiety started,"Okay so I was just in deep thought about some things that were traumatic to me and then made me have some questions. So my father died when I was 6 from drinking and he was an iron worker so took Tylenol a lot, double whammy on liver and kidneys failed.  I am 2 years younger than my brother. So my mother struggled working 3 jobs to keep house and maybe 4 years later met my step dad and we eventually moved to a new town.  So now my mom was around more cause she had help. I was babied by my mom, I grew an attachment to her when my dad died and my brother kinda went the other way being rebellious and whatnot. So I listened to my mom and step dad who was a nice guy.  My brother fought with him saying he isn't his dad and don't tell him what to do and all that shit. I kinda shut down and don't take sides. Anyways fast forward I'm now about to be graduating college in 2012 and this is when my anxiety started. Up until now I was in school and didnt have to ""be an adult"". So all senior yesr I had anxiety and nightmares. This is where it began and then this reinforced it; my mom says they are moving to Florida so I need to get an apartment...not to get too into it but I felt abandoned, even tho deep down I knew I had to grow up and start living independently but it's was so scary because I was hiding a newly formed addiction to Percocet ..  so the last year we lived all together my brother had become best friends with my step dad and I was the outcast. They knew something was wrong but not whst. I started skipping car payments spending it all on expensive perk 30s doing 3 or 4 a day at 25 bucks each. I was a computer programmer so I made a good amount of money but I was in debt and barely surviving went to rehab once before my mom moved and I came back did good but eventually lost job. I had gotten in a relationship with an older woman who was getting a divorce so we latched onto each other and ended up living together but that's a different story. I just think that once my mother found out I was doing what I was, she went to tough love mode and that's the last thing I wanted. And then she moved many hundreds of miles away.....I felt abandoned in life.  To this day I still struggle with addiction and being depressed and lost. My older brother doesn't get why I can't just stop, I have had year long stints, but he don't understand addiction. As I used to be mad at my dad for choosing to drink instead of being with his two kids and wife and then I became an addict and I understood that it's a lot more complicated.....

"Anxiety so bad I haven’t eaten in days, mom threatening to take me to the ER.","I caught some sort of bad common cold, urgent care said it wasn't the flu or covid.

I’m convinced TikTok or something is driving me into an existential depression.,"I’m from Richmond, VA. Not a small town, I guess. But for me, Richmond, the east coast is really all I know.

I don’t have the ability to see the world as much as I desperately wish I could. 

I was not a huge fan of TikTok initially. I’m a pretty non-social person in general. But then I started scrolling, and found that I did enjoy it! Seeing people all over the world showing off their lives, their normalcy, then seeing historic monuments and sights through the lenses of others, then seeing people who relate to the same struggle, then learning about different interests and things people have that we all actually share. 

But now… I’m just depressed. So depressed. I’m in the “section” of TikTok where I’m learning about all the things I’ve avoided looking into (unsolved disappearances, murders, government conspiracies, etc.) and then I end up in the physics section and then just… deeper and deeper I go. 

The world is small for me. I feel like my problems are insignificant. But TikTok reminds me that the world is huge, that life sucks for everyone unless you’re lucky enough. It reminds me of war, of famine, of depression, of animal cruelty, and most of all - it reminds me that none of this can be changed by me and none of it fucking matters anyway because we’re all going to die in the end.

I haven’t felt like I’m in such a dark place in so long. I’m nostalgic for things that I’m not sure ever existed. I crave to see and understand others but simultaneously wish I could just… disappear from all this.

"Failed Relationship & Social Anxiety, and how I'm overcoming both.","I had been in a committed relationship with my best friend of 20+ years for a very long time. We've had a lot of ups & downs over the years, and eventually moved in together about 4 years ago. We talked about marriage & having a child & moving to Vermont later in life too.
  
Unfortunately moving in was the beginning of the end, as we slowly drifted apart and our verbal arguments grew more common and more intense (due to PTSD on her part and years of depression/anxiety from isolation & cancer treatment on mine). Eventually she managed to get out of her funk and chose to date/get physical with other men, which drove extreme jealousy in me and drove her further away. Eventually I got to the point where I simply could stand another man in our house, so I gave up on anything beyond friendship & asked her to move out (tho that has yet to happen).  
  
At that point a few months ago, my mind was racing every day, and the tension between us was constantly boiling. I had to do something more than monthly therapy and Effexor - the med is FANTASTIC at helping me day-to-day with anxiety and my focus for work, but the extreme jealousy was still there causing major outbursts of anger.  
  
At some point I decided I needed to get out and meet other women, but that's always been difficult for me since I'm hella shy. A very old HS friend/flame of mine recommended not trying to find a relationship, but instead said I should check out the BSDM scene. Not only would it be very easy to get laid and relieve some tension, but the people involved in the scene are usually VERY welcoming. And who knows maybe I'd find a new relationship.  
  
So now it's 2-3 months since attending my first gathering. Things at home have calmed down, tho it still bugs me a lot that she doesn't respect my boundary about screwing when I'm around. I've met some really awesome & fun people (not always for sex) and their collective confidence has really helped me be less introverted/depressed and more understanding of myself and other people. I'm not sure if I can find someone as uniquely amazing as my best friend can be, but I've met a couple women with potential.",anxiety,,Vermont,44.5990718,-72.5002608

questions to ask a cardiologist,"I will be doing a video interview of a cardiologist and asking him questions from the POV of someone dealing with cardiac anxiety. I will be uploading the video on YT.  
  
When I was facing cardiac anxiety, YT and strangers in forums like this one, helped more than any therapist could. I am sharing below some questions I will be asking. If you have any questions please share in comments:

1. Can repeated panic attacks or frequent palpitations harm the heart over time?
2. How reliable are tests like ECGs, echocardiograms, and Holter monitors in detecting real heart issues?
3. What are the harmless ECG changes commonly seen during a panic/anxiety attack?
4. At what point should someone stop getting repeated heart tests and focus on managing their anxiety instead?
5. What is your advice to those who constantly seek medical reassurance but still doubt their results?
6. What are some key differences between the sensations of a heart attack and a panic attack?
7. If all tests are normal, but I still have chest pain or palpitations, when should I next visit my cardiologist for a check up
8. Do long-term beta blockers weaken the heart
9. What role do lifestyle factors play in protecting the heart despite ongoing anxiety?
10. Why does anxiety cause chest pain and palpitations",anxiety,,YT,63.000147,-136.002502
Sertraline dosage increase from 50 mg to 75 mg – is there still hope?,"Hi everyone,

Please be kind — I know that everyone reacts differently, but I’m starting to lose a bit of hope. I’m one of those people who finds comfort in reading about others’ experiences, because it reminds me that I’m not alone.

I’m seeing a psychiatrist and I’m committed to doing the work. I don’t want to sabotage my own progress, so I really put a lot of energy into healing — for myself, to grow.

Back in December, I hit a very low point. I’ve been in therapy for 3.5 months now. I went to my psychiatrist with generalized anxiety and depressive episodes. I’ve been on 25 mg of sertraline since I was 16. I’m 30 now, and that “baby dose” helped until recently — most likely because it turned out I have a rare medical condition.

My whole journey peaked in January last year, when I found out I can’t have children unless I have surgery — but here in Hungary, they don’t really know how to do it. I tend to avoid things, so my husband and I buried ourselves in work. Winter is off-season for me, and in December everything I hadn’t processed came crashing down. I’ve always had anxiety, but by then I reached the point of having daily panic attacks and depressive episodes. I finally found a psychiatrist I trust, who really sees what I’m going through.

I started with 50 mg for a few weeks, then increased to 75 mg. The first 2 weeks were absolute hell. Now I’m at the end of week 4 on 75 mg. A few days ago I felt somewhat functional, but today I had panic attacks just like the ones I had back in December. That dark, ominous feeling and gut-wrenching anxiety were there all day.

I’m fighting. I don’t want to give up.

So please, if you’ve ever increased your dose (not necessarily to 75 mg) — is there still hope? Will it get better? Will the world open up for me again? Is it possible to feel more stable by week 6? Is it normal to still feel this up and down in week 4?

One more thing that may be relevant: I also have IBS and enteroptosis, which may affect absorption. So my system might be slower to respond.

Thank you so much to anyone willing to share their experience or encouragement. It really means a lot. :)

Dental Anxiety & Redemption,"When I was 18 years old, I needed to make a trip to the dentist's due to a toothache I was experiencing in my third molar; due to my ignorance of dental work, I opted towards extracting my molar instead of saving it via root canal. 

I stepped into that clinic brave as can be knowing I've experienced a few surgeries under my belt. Yet, nothing could have prepared me for the immense feeling of pressure as the dentist removed my tooth off my jaw. I have always had a pretty high pain tolerance but even with the anaesthesia, the pressure sent my body into full panic mode. After the procedure, I almost passed out.

3 years later (around 1 week ago as of writing), my third molar on the other side started to ache. I could've went to the dentist ASAP but that last experience had scarred me so bad that I pushed it off as much as I could. The night before my supposed procedure, I almost had a panic attack thinking about my previous experience.

I just had my procedure done today, a few days from my supposed procedure due to a power outtage in the area. It was with a new dentist that I had communicated all my concerns and worries with and they tried to provide the best care they could.

There was a minor issue with the anaesthetic not working as effectively due to my previous medication but my dentist tried to make the procedure as painless as he could. Overall, it was significantly better than my previous extraction and I walked out there with a win.

Hopefully, to anyone in the same boat as I was, I hope you have your win too. 

Feel free to ask questions too because my experience having a tooth extracted with the anaesthetic not working properly is pretty gnarly, and I'd be happy to provide some insights and reassurance.",anxiety,,anaesthesia,51.5194312,-0.1450659
Automatic Rumination / thoughts stuck on anxiety 24/7,"Hi everyone. I’ve been lurking on this subreddit for months now and I’ve finally decided to reach out for some support / advice from this amazing community. 

For the last 6 months I’ve been stuck in experiencing a hyperawareness / hyperfocus on my own thoughts. It’s nothing new to me, as I’ve had around 4 episodes of extended periods of this (6 months+) over the last 12 years. I had an intrusive thought / sensation one night in September 2024 where I just felt hyperaware of my thoughts, and as I know that I can get stuck on this for months, I started to panic. Fast forward 6 months, all I can think about every waking second is my thoughts, my anxiety, how to just let my mind wander and how to just let go. The insanity it is causing is extreme and has led to severe anxiety and, more recently, depression as I find I cannot connect with anyone or relate to anything as my lived experience over the last 6 months has just been me thinking about thinking. It’s let to DP/DR and base line anxiety of like 6/10 at all times, and usually like 9/10 every morning. 

The reason I am reaching out is that my therapist and psychiatric really don’t seem to understand that this is 24/7 and haven’t been very helpful in providing any practical advice here. I’ve really really tried to accept that I have no control over what my mind does, but because this rumination feels automatic and 24/7 it’s very difficult to let it go without automatically trying to solve this. I know I have some agency here, so when I do catch myself ruminating, I gently try to refocus on the present … but this lasts about 3 seconds until my brain is back on the topic. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

As a background, I am a 30 year old male in the UK and what really compounds my issue is that I stupidly experimented with MDMA 12 years ago and woke up with a massive out-of-body panic attack and anxiety that persisted for many months following. All this hyper awareness / 24/7 automatic rumination of my thoughts started following this experience, and over the last 12 years, has led to the core self belief that I’ve damaged my brain. I gues part of the hyperfixation on my mental health / mind is because of this belief, which I suppose is why it is so sticky. Following the experience with MDMA-induced anxiety, this hyperawareness theme dominated my life for about a year. 

Any advice here would be extremely appreciated. I have a beautiful 18 month daughter and the fact that I am struggling to connect with her because of this is one of the hardest parts about this.

I'm worried I'm losing my hair,"I tried posting this to a hair loss subreddit but the automod removed it.

Hi, I'm a 29 year old male and for the last few months or so I've been considering starting hair loss treatment.

I live in the UK and one of the most popular results is a company called Manual who provide either a spray or oral treatment, with the oral treatment being more effective. I completed their questionnaire which recommended I begin an all-in-one treatment that combines Finasteride, Minoxidil and Biotin in a single pill: https://www.manual.co/n/hair-loss/recommendations?atc=false

The problem is I have no idea if I'm really balding or not or if this company is legit. I see products like this everywhere online and it's hard to trust them. Sometimes my hair seems fine, other times I can't seem to do anything with it. Sometimes it's as though I don't have enough hair around the temples, other times it's like I have too much!

I naturally have curly hair and it was worse when I was a child. In my teens, I cut my hair extremely short. During the pandemic however, I chose to grow my hair out a little and actually preferred it. I felt a little bit better about myself by having an extra bit of scruff on my head.

But since then I've become worried that I'll lose it or that it's thinning. My dad, his brother and father all started balding, though they still retain enough hair that they can get away with having it cut extremely short. The men on my mother's side though have much fuller hairstyles, with my great-grandfather retaining a full head of hair up until he died and my mother's uncle and brother experiencing only some receding.

I've heard it's most likely that you'll inherit your dad's hairstyle but I'm not sure how true this is. My dad has hair around the sides and at the front but not much elsewhere. I've been told though that my hair colour is most similar to my mother's though and even inherited her curliness, so I'm not exactly sure where my genetics lie.

Washing my hair can be a pain because it took some time to settle on a product. I used to use Head and Shoulders but it made my hair greasy looking. I've since switched to Cien and use shampoo and conditioner separately, but I struggle to decide when not to shampoo my hair or add conditioner. Sometimes it looks good, other times it looks terrible.

I struggle with a lot of anxiety depression, and worry that I may have caused my balding by worrying about it in the first place. Generally I have been feeling better but I'll have bouts of absolutely terrible lows and spend most of my time worrying about one particular thing.

I'm not unhealthy but I wouldn't say I'm healthy either. I'm thin and try to eat healthy, but I don't get out much and have takeout once every week as a treat. I'm hoping to start exercising at home, which I did start about a year ago but fell out of practice. I heard though that this can induce testosterone which can inadvertently contribute to hair loss, so I'm a little terrified to begin.

Even if I'm not balding, I have thought about starting treatment as a precaution. I'm nowhere near at the stage that many people on here are at. I have no bald patches aside from struggling with my temples on occasion or thinking that my hair is thinning in certain areas. Looking at before and after photos makes me confident that it can be reversed.

But I'm also concerned that starting treatment prematurely will cause the opposite and make me go bald faster. I've heard that shedding can occur and I'm worried that the treatment may not work correctly or if for whatever reason I stop it that I begin balding faster than I had been previously, if I even am balding.

I'm not too concerned about some of the other symptoms commonly discussed. If I'm being perfectly honest, I could do with a decreased sex drive as I think I may be hypersexual and it can seriously impact my desire to do anything else but masturbate all the time, which probably doesn't help my hair either.

Either way I'm divided over starting treatment. I don't want to leave it too late but I also don't want to try to fix a problem that isn't even there. Going bald terrifies me because it would absolutely kill what little self-confidence I have.",anxiety,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525

Anguere: A Short Story About Anxiety,"You know that strange feeling you always get, like someone is watching you, that something is about to go wrong, that you’re about to mess up, that you did mess up, that nothing’s going to get better and it’s all your fault? That’s Anguere, at least, that’s what I decided to call them. Yes, all of those thoughts and feelings, those urges and temptations, the fears that keep you from commitment, that is in fact a being, a creature no less. They exist within all of us, but we can feel them outside of us, coiled around our skin like a snake. Each one is as unique as every individual human being, and they are here to stay. No matter where you are, at work, at school, out on a date, out on a walk,  among friends, and when you’re all alone, your Angurere is with you. Their presence varies, they can be subtle as an itch or as explicit as a stranglehold, it really depends how much you let them get away with. 

To describe the appearance of Anguere would be an arduous task, because though everyone has something like them, no one else can see mine, and no one else can see yours. You alone are the one being who can see your Anguere, and it may even take some time to recognize them. But they are there, from conception all the way until our final rest, at which they pass away with us. There is a way to catch sight of Anguere, simply stare into a mirror and look for all your imperfections. Any bits of acne you may have, any discoloration with your teeth, bits of facial hair you forgot to shave off, parts of your hair that are starting to bald or desperately need a cut. Take a chance to look at all of it at once, put it into a complete picture and stare directly at it. You’ve found your Anguere. 

Angueres possess a variety of different abilities, though not all are shared amongst their kind. While they grow up with us, Anguere and their brethren learn what makes us nervous, scared, and hesitant, and they develop their powers based on such. What these powers all have in common is the ability to distort our reality, make us question ourselves, cause us to go back on our promises, make us always consider “what if?” 

They can magnify our mistakes and minimize our achievements. They can narrow our mind until we can only see the worst possible outcomes. They can generalize our emotions, make us think our worst moments define us. They can make us think our acts have influenced our situations, even when they may be completely unrelated. They make us believe that we are responsible for everything, even that for which we have no control over. They make us jump to conclusions. They convince us that they’re mind readers and fortune tellers, letting us know what others think of us or how a situation will turn out badly. They heighten our worst emotions until we believe they are the absolute truths. They remind us constantly of what we should’ve done but couldn’t. And they make us only think in absolutes, all or nothing, no inbetween. 

Those are the main abilities displayed by Anguere and they’re kind, and surely you’ve recognized at least some of their powers. Rarely do they possess all these abilities, as a good manipulator plays their cards sparingly, always waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. For some of us, said opportunities are few and far between, a twitch you may feel every once in a while. But for others, for me, I’ve let my Anguere play their tricks on me for so long that they’ve become part of my life. I listen to them, I echo their words to myself, I’ve even let them wrap their hands around my throat and close it. It wasn't a choke, I could still breathe, but something always felt wrong inside. Their manipulation made me feel as if my life was slipping away, my body was losing its functions, and that one day I may go to sleep and never wake up. Truth of the matter is, that was all part of the game. 

After all of this, you must be wondering if there’s anything we can do to combat our Angueres? Well, first things first, I must tell you that there is no way to eliminate an Anguere, they are a part of us, as fundamental as our skin and bones. To try to kill Anguere would be to resort to barbaric pseudoscience that never worked decades ago and won’t work now. My Angurere will only die when I die, and that is the same for all of us.  Whether we like it or not, Anguere will always be with us, will always be a part of our lives, and will always influence our decisions, because on some level, they are us. I am Anguere, and Anguere is me. 

However, that’s not to say there’s nothing that can be done. Anguere and their kind may be a part of us, but that doesn’t mean they have to control us. The first thing to do is to remind yourself that though they are a part of you, they are not your entirety. There are other parts of you, parts that motivate you to work, create, discover, and experience all of life’s offerings. Everytime that you do something, especially in spite of what your Anguere tells you, you are slowly but surely untethering their influence over you. When you write your novel, learn a new skill, make a song, play a sport, go to a job interview, or take any step towards something you want, something that’ll enrich your life, Anguere’s grip begins to weaken. 

The other fundamental thing to remember is that though Anguere is something inside all of us, that means that as humans, they are a shared experience between all of us, and that means we can help one another deal with these creatures. All these thoughts that the Anguere sends through your head, tell them to your loved ones. Friends, family, partners, teachers, and role models, especially if sometimes the thoughts the Anguere puts in your head is about them. Let them reassure you that they aren’t true, and to remind you of the love you have for one another. They may even be open to sharing their own experiences with an Anguere, and you can offer some reassurance of your own. Perhaps they’ve also had problems dealing with their Anguere, and they know someone who can help. 

The Anguere is a part of us all, and in some ways, it is a being that’s neutral in nature. It could make you second guess something reckless, something that could get yourself or someone else hurt and back you away from the ledge. But when you let it control every decision in your life and every thought within your mind, that’s when it becomes a problem, an abuser. The good news is that though the Anguere’s powers are vast, they all boil down to thoughts, and thoughts can be overcome with action. Taking care of yourself, being with those you care about, and looking toward the future with an effort to face it no matter what it entails. The Anguere is scary, but it’s just another part of life, and a small one at that. Life has many adversaries, but there are also just as many allies, ready and willing to help you complete the arduous adventure you’ve been sent on. ",anxiety,,Anguere,9.5072979,2.0038734
Terrible Anxiety on Cloudy Days,"I started having severe anxiety issues in May 2006. I still remember my life changing after a severe panic attack in Atlanta traffic. That being said, I have noticed in these almost 20 years that on cloudy rainy days, my anxiety is out of hand. Yesterday and today have been extremely cloudy. I feel physically and mentally sick on cloudy days. I thought I was going to have to leave church early this morning because my anxiety was running wild. However, this past Friday, it was perfectly sunny, and I went hiking and did a bunch of stuff and had a ton of energy.

Shaky vibrating muscles all over for 2 weeks now,"I have terrible health anxiety for the last few years now after I started having PVC's(thankfully they've stopped) and I think of the worst thing possible when it comes to my body symptoms. I have scoliosis so my body has always caused pain and twitches anywhere and everywhere my whole life, so thats never bothered me. I don't think I've ever been shaky really, not that I've ever noticed. However, I woke up 2 weeks ago with internal vibrations and also physically slightly vibrating when I move. At rest I dont move at all. Also having full ears that I pop constantly and dizziness. Its not debilitating or stopping me from moving thankfully. Its mostly noticeable in my arms and hands or if I move my head slowly, but its all over my body, its all shaky. Also I am very tense all over. I try to relax but a few seconds later my body tightens right back up. The shaking gets worse after working out. Its been constant for 2 weeks now, Im terrified. I have a dr appt with my PCP in a couple days. Magnesium doesn't seem to be helping. Its not my blood sugar, BP, Liver, Pancreas, or Thyroid, I had it all checked. My bloodwork is all clear. Im just so scared because my grandfather on my dads side died of ALS in his old age and a family friend was just diagnosed with Parkinson's. Someone please give me some hope that its just my stupid brain and its anxiety doing this to me.

"Angststörung, Depression oder doch eine verdeckte narzistische Persönlichkeitsstörung","Hallo,

Erstmal Entschuldigung für die lange Story, eventuell bin ich ja nicht der einzige damit.

Ich stecke gerade in einem großen Schlamassel. 

Ich erkläre mal meine Situation, eventuell habt ihr einen Rat oder ähnliche Erfahrungen (ich finde es hilft sehr in Reddit von Menschen zu Lesen die ähnliches Erfahrungen).

Ich bin jetzt M25 und das erste Mal mit dem Thema psychische Gesundheit beziehungsweise einer Erkrankung kam ich mit etwa 18 Jahren. 

Es war nach der Schule, ich wusste nicht so recht was ich machen will/soll und geriet nach und nach in einen depressiven Zustand. Ich war unzufrieden mit mir selbst und verbrachte die meiste Zeit zuhause. Nach einer gewissen Zeit suchte ich mir psychotherapeutische Hilfe, da ich einfach keine Emotionen mehr empfunden habe. Dort wurde mir die Diagnose Depression gestellt. Meine Therapeutin ist recht schnell was das verschreiben von Medikamenten angeht, weshalb mir umgehend Bupropion und Sertralin verordnet wurde. Ich bemerkte insgesamt wenig bewusste Veränderung durch das Medikament, aber eventuell halfen sie mir dabei von zu Hause auszuziehen und mich generell wieder zu öffnen. Ich bin in eine WG gezogen, begann mein Studium und fand sogar eine Freundin. Retrospektiv war sie wahrscheinlich auch einer der Hauptgründe weshalb es mir besser gieng und ich neues Selbstbewusstsein fand und mich neue Dinge traute. 

Damals waren meine Hauptprobleme ein negatives Selbstbild und ständige Selbstzweifel. Meine Freundin war stets liebevoll und unterstützend und trotzdem habe ich sie kritisiert und wahrscheinlich unter Druck gesetzt. Ich sagte ihr, dass ich nicht weis ob ich sie liebe da ich immernoch nicht richtig wusste meine Gefühle zu deuten. Es kam schließlich zur Trennung, was letztendlich von ihr aus gieng. Ich war tief traurig und merkte wie viel sie mir eigentlich bedeutete und wie ich mich teilweise schlecht verhielt. Ich war innerlich wirklich zerrissen und konnte mir nicht vorstellen ohne sie zu leben und die Beziehung auszugeben. Ich habe ihr das so gesagt und nach Monaten fanden wir wieder zusammen.

Wir führten/führen seitdem eine gute und unterstützende Beziehung.

Ich setzte meine Antidepressiva vor etwa 6 Monaten ab, da ich keine Notwendigkeit mehr darin sah. 

In mir ist schon seit der Trennung eine große Angst dass es wieder zu einer Trennung kommen könnte, allerdings haben diese nicht meinen Tag bestimmt. Seit etwa 2 Monaten haben sich meine Angst vor einer Trennung allerdings stark zugespitzt, bis ich nach einem Monat nicht mehr schlafen konnte und völlig rastlos war, ich musste die ganze Zeit herumlaufen. 

Nach mehrten Tagen in diesem Zustand wandelte sich meine Angst von Verlustangst auf einmal in eine tiefgreifende Angst vor dem Tod und dem Leben selbst. Ich hinterfrage meine ganzes Leben, mir wurde bewusst wie egoistisch ich in meinem Leben gehandelt habe . Ich informierte mich was wirklich falsch mit mir ist und bin davon überzeugt ein verdeckter Narzisst zu sein. In mir kamen starke Selbstmord wünsche und ein Bedürfnis nicht mehr zu existieren. Ich suchte bei meinen Eltern Hilfe und diese fuhren mich in die Notaufnahme einer Psychatrischen Praxis. Diese verschrieben mir Sertralin und Mirtazapin um schlafen zu können, sowie Tavor für den Notfall. Tatsächlich hat das meine Angst gedämpft und ich konnte schlafen, allerdings bleibt meine Überzeugung ein verdeckter Narzisst zu sein und höchst manipulativ. Mit diesem Bewusstsein kann ich einfach nicht leben und alles erscheint mir falsch was ich tue. Niemand wirklich niemand aus meinem Umfeld würde bestätigen dass ich ein Narzisst bin, einschließlich meiner Therapeutin. Ich glaube das liegt an meiner schüchternen Ausendarstellung. Mir wurde aber klar dass ich äußerst manipulativ bin und wenig Emphatie habe, auch wenn ich das immer zu glauben gehabt habe. Zu diesem Thema liest man eigentlich nur dass es keine Heilung geben kann und diese Menschen einfach gemieden werden sollen. Ich weis nicht was ich tun kann und wie ich damit fertig werden soll. Eventuell ist es auch eine Zwangsstörung oder etwas anderes aber ich weis nicht ob das einen Unterschied macht. Ich bin verzweifelt und wollte fragen ob es jemand gibt der schonmal in seinem Leben an so einem Punkt war und eventuell einen Tipp hat oder einen Funken Hoffnung?

Post-surgery anxiety?,"Ten days ago I had general anesthesia for the first time for a laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Recovery has mostly gone well except for what seems like the onset of new anxiety. For context, I’m diagnosed GAD and have struggled for years but have mostly gotten my symptoms under control in the last few years without medication. 

I am getting these episodes of what feels like sudden lightheadedness, weakness and unsteadiness. A wave of anxiety comes over me and then my more familiar anxiety symptoms kick in. I have to lay down and then it passes after a few minutes. So far I haven’t actually passed out, I just feel like I might. I can’t tell if the whole thing is a panic attack or if something else is causing the lightheadedness and then it triggers my anxiety. Typically my anxiety response has not really felt like this.

I told my surgeon about it on day 5 and she said it’s normal to feel tired and lightheaded for a few days after surgery. But by day 8 it hadn’t gone away so I saw my PCP. They ran a bunch of tests and did blood work - everything is normal. 

Has anyone else experienced this after surgery, or as part of anxiety in general? I’m scared it’s not going to end. I have to go back to work on Tuesday. My plan is to take my Ativan in the AM before work, that way if it is anxiety related it will hopefully prevent it from happening. So far these episodes have only happened before I’ve taken my anxiety meds, so that’s also notable. ",anxiety,,anesthesia,36.253332650000004,-86.68369799094495
New Here,"Good morning (or afternoon) Reddit! I’m curious if anyone here has any experience with “free-floating” anxiety. A little back story: Around Thanksgiving, I came down with strep throat that put me down for a week. Shortly after that I began the transition back to my then “old” job and I also enrolled in school. The day I started back at this job (December 16th) I came down with the flu. I worked through it since I didn’t want to come back and already start calling in although my boss is amazing and wouldn’t have cared. It’s just not my style and I got through it and felt fine afterwards. During all of this, I started to have depersonalization thoughts and got on the internet to try and see what the hell I had going on. I had never had episodes like this nor have I ever been formally diagnosed with anxiety. These were sort of just days or hours that would pass and I’d feel normal again. There was no definitive trigger. Fast forward a little bit to mid-late January, I had my very first panic attack overnight. The feeling literally woke me up out of sleep and I couldn’t get back to bed for at least a couple hours. The feeling was just general anxiety but seriously about nothing in particular. It was a DPDR sort of feeling and I began to obsess over what was going on in my brain. Since that very hour, I have not once felt totally the same. Over the past few months I have gone back and forth with my new therapist, my new psychiatrist, and my primary care doctor. My therapist thinks the strep throat fucked up my brain since the onset was extremely rapid and out of nowhere. My primary care doctor sucks but it’s impossible to get a new doctor although I’ve been trying. They keep pushing anxiety on me but to me, it’s odd these feelings come and go with no trigger WHATSOEVER. We thought it could be my thyroid through labs but they came back “good” so the SSRI I was on for a week, I was told to get off of since we had supposedly found the solution.

Present day, I’m unmedicated and just deal with whatever the fuck comes my way. I know for a fact, my brain is not the same as it was before my panic attack. I get these feelings of DPDR and general, disturbing unease totally randomly but to be honest it’s always lingering..it just varies in how extreme it is. It’s definitely ALWAYS on the “bad” end though. I’m planning on telling my psychiatrist that I’d like to get back on an SSRI because I guess it won’t hurt. I just don’t really understand what’s wrong with me. Today I read about “free-floating” anxiety which brings me here, but even so it still seems like that flavor of anxiety has SOME triggers and at least has a reason to exist.

I’m here to basically say hi and ask, what the fuck is wrong with me? Does this story even make sense? Will I EVER feel normal again? Can persistent anxiety really just introduce itself overnight and legit have no trigger? I’m gonna add too, when this anxiety hits..I’m not thinking about any external triggers whatsoever. I just get overly obsessed with the fact “I’m not normal anymore” and tweak out mentally. I am a relatively healthy 34M with no serious underlying health conditions (or so I thought).

I cannot function enough to fix my life,"My anxiety is so severe that I cannot even do the basics of life. I cannot look after myself and the place I live in, I cannot apply for enough jobs, I can't perform well in interviews, I can't maintain relationships, I can't maintain (or afford) hobbies, etc. I've been unemployed for the last 11 months or so since I graduated from my Master's. My main career choice fell apart under the weight of reality and nothing else inspires me or is viable. I can't even get a minimum wage entry-level job (e.g., retail) because interviewers don't like me. Too anxious, too awkward, too autistic, etc. Not 'natural' enough no matter how much I try.

Because of this I can't afford therapy, I can't afford private psychiatry, I can't afford rTMS (like £8000+ per tranche in the UK!), I can't afford to do anything fun, I can't afford to make friends, etc. I have to skip meals to be able to attend my job centre meetings. I can't afford to or cope with networking (I scarcely even know what it is). I can't even send emails.

I'm on various wait lists but obviously they're years long and I can't wait that long. I don't think I'll be alive in 5 years with how things are going.

Because I'm not imminently about to kill myself there's pretty much no help available, and because I have no friends in-person I have nobody to talk to other than my partner whom I'm already overburdening massively.

I've been trying to send an email to an old professor for the last 3 hours and I've managed to write about 3 sentences. It's pathetic. I'm not getting enough job applications done, I'm anxious in every interview I do, I can't afford to attend networking events, I can't make decisions about my future because of analysis paralysis, etc etc. How am I meant to have any self-esteem when my functioning is so low?

I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I'm not allowed to kill myself but I'm also not given the support to help me fix my life, nor can I do it myself when I can't even do the basic fundamentals needed to get through the day. I stay up all night because I can't regulate my emotions and I'm so distressed, even after taking sleeping tablets.

I've tried 15(!!) medications (including 4 ADHD medications-I also have ADHD but it's treatment resistant so none of them helped) and loads of therapists in the past but none of them helped. I've tried mindfulness for years and it didn't work. What more can I do? How am I supposed to have any hope in a future worth living? I just want to die so badly but I can't because it'd destroy my parents and my partner. It's not fair.

What actions can I take? What am I meant to do? I'm so stuck.",anxiety,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525

Panic episodes that last days/weeks?,"I don't think I can do this. 

I thought I'd had panic attacks before but a little over a month ago I had the MOTHER of panic attacks. I woke up one morning after a night of drinking and was already mid panic attack. I tried every trick in the book to calm down for hours, called my bf to come home from work and then eventually went to ER who just told me to lay off coffee and gave me half a valium which did nothing and sent me home. For 38 days now I've been in panic mode, on the edge of having a panic attack but it never actually coming. I spend all day trying not to panic and bring my heart rate down until I wear myself out and fall asleep. Some days are better than others but I'm never not panicking and my heart rate never goes down. It's debilitating. I'm delerious and scared 24/7.

Hello she living situation for someone with anxiety,"Hello,

I’m on my sub account to stay anonymous.

Currently, I’m (33f) living in Japan with my younger sister (28f), older sister (35f), and her baby.  It’s my older sister’s apartment, and me and my little sister and I are sharing an office as our room. 
I have severe social anxiety. My older sister is an extreme extrovert and she wants to invite people multiple times a week. On weekends, she has friends over for 6-8 hours both Saturday and Sunday. I say hi and bye when they come, which is as much as I can muster. But of course, her friends get suspicious when I’m locking myself in the room for pretty much all day.

I’m worried that I’m hurting my sister’s reputation (they are all work friends in an extremely network-based work) I try to stay out when they are there, but I can’t do this for 6-8 hours every weekend/sometimes weekdays. 

Also, my older sister is very strict and yells at me for everything, including things my little sister has done such as breaking my older sister’s wooden spoons and sofa maker. Nowadays, I’m always vigilant and afraid of leaving my room/even staying in this arrangement. I feel to paralyzed to pursue my hobbies and interests.

Do you have any advice on how I can improve my interaction with her, or try to live peacefully? ",anxiety,,Japan,36.5748441,139.2394179
scared i’m going to get schizophrenia,"i smoked weed back in november. i am 15. i have no one in my family with schizophrenia. the thing is when i smoked this weed, i saw the room fading away and my inner voice screaming “no” super loud but it sounded like an outside voice. that only lasted like 5 seconds. i kept on derealizing. it was horrible. i then thought that maybe there was an alternate version of me trying to take over my mind but it was more of a what it. i was literally trying tif ight the anxiety or whatever was giving me fear in my mind. but again it was more of a “what if” i would just tell myself that im fine and that its ok. i didn’t feel real. i started telling myself my name my parents name my age my birthday i knew everything but for some reason i still didn’t feel real. so i told my friend to tell me that i was real and i was like ok its ok im fine. i then had another “what if” like what if me and my friends dog switched souls. but then i was like yea no way if we did id be in her body like bye what am i thinking. i’m just really scared that i went through psychosis. everything left after the high stopped. i still had “what ifs” and a lot of anxiety and health anxiety. i would have ones like “what if im a dream or a coma” or “what if my mom is texting my aunt who’s a psychologist that she thinks somethings wrong with me because im acting weird. (i had to check her phone so that my brain could calm down cause i would tell myself no she’s not but i couldn’t convince myself) or “what if im actually saying stuff out loud and people are hearing me” or “(every time i looked up i would see people just stare at me but i would stare at them first so obviously they would stare at me in the halls) what if everyone is looking at me because im acting weird or doing weird movements) i also had “flashbacks” of the room feeling weird or fading away. i’m gonna be honest memory isn’t reliable so idk if i felt it zooming away or if it was actually zooming away. but i also heard about HPPD and it sounds A LOT like what i had. i haven’t had the flashbacks since i think December. my brain keeps telling me i won’t develop it but then it’s cares me and says what if i do. i’m overthinking a lot and idk what to do. i’ve only smoked weed 6-7 times and i plan on NEVER doing it again. my brain also tells me that what if i wasn’t thinking what ifs and im just saying that it was what ifs so that i don’t actually sound like i was going through psychosis. ugh i hate this sm. i also had depersonalization for a month. i couldn’t  recognize myself in the mirror. it was horrible. i know you guys can’t diagnose me but at least tell me what this sounds like.",anxiety,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
COVID and then all of a sudden.. anxiety!,"I don’t know if my experience will help anyone and might be a load of nonsense to some but I read a similar post on here

So to introduce myself I’m 35M no history of MH issues or anxiety of any description and work in a fairly high pressure environment all day everyday without issue.. had Covid few years ago and was ill but not badly.. same again last year and was unwell but nothing to write about 

About a week or so later I started getting shortness of breath when not doing much at all.. but I could exercise and be fine.. then I had a panic attack. 

I’ve never experienced a panic attack before so this was a bit of a shock. Next thing I know I’m having what felt like a 2 month long panic attack.. constant shortness of breath, anxiety first thing when I wake up, a sensation of my throat being tight and too much phlegm in my throat, random intense adrenaline, dizziness, DPDR. Several trips to the doctors/hospital feeling something was seriously wrong etc loads of tests and they tell me it could be long covid/could be anxiety but ultimately they don’t know. My mind was in overdrive constantly and it was exhausting.

I found that walking helped and I lost nearly two stone in weight from not eating, being wired and walking loads as it seemed to give a temporary relief.

I paid for CBT privately over the following months which helped in gaining some reassurance initially and some of the techniques were useful. Especially the pursed lip breathing/facing the feelings and sitting with them/remembering that they are just sensations and are harmless

I spent more time out on my mountain bike/hiking doing relaxing activities that promote “mindfulness” and doing these activities for the right reasons and what I mean by that is being in the frame of mind to relax not to relieve the anxiety. This was a BIG mistake I made to start off with.. I was walking like a maniac etc because it gave me relief from the symptoms not necessarily because i wanted to.. turns out frame of mind matters when you’re attempting to soothe your out of whack nervous system!!

I really struggled to accept that it was anxiety due to the severe symptoms with seemingly no ‘mental’ component to it. Researching my symptoms just gave me zero clarity and if anything made me concerned that I had something more sinister. These now I can see as fairly typical traits of health anxiety which is a viscous circle to get stuck in.. 

Continued CBT through the NHS and that also was useful.

I’m fairly convinced that that Covid infection started these whole shenanigans BUT I do think that whatever started it/sent my body into a tailspin is kind of irrelevant now and really shouldn’t be the focus for anyone going through the same thing as it’s not helpful. The focus I should have had at the start was dealing with the result - the anxiety.

I feel that it’s been a teachable experience for me in the crazy symptoms your brain can give you. What’s worse is the links it makes.. you get a dry mouth maybe from not drinking enough or hot day something NORMAL and your mind goes DRY MOUTH? well last time you had a DRY MOUTH you had a panic attack maybe we should put everything into high alert and have a panic attack for good measure!!! Unbelievable.. and it’s hard to break those links to start with 

I’m now 9 months down the line and still my fight or flight is out of whack but it’s considerably better and I no longer get the shortness of breath, dizziness but still get the adrenaline feeling and some throat tightness but it’s less intense. 

Be interesting to hear similar experiences and most importantly anything that helped you? ",anxiety,,DPDR,-4.4154704,119.6168858062613

I have terrible anxiety that there's something wrong with my car.,"Hi all.

I have terrible anxiety that something is wrong with my vehicle.

This week it's manifesting itself thinking the suspension is faulty and that leads me down a rabbit hole of googling etc.

My car recently had it's MOT (I'm in the UK) and as part of that they do a full health check on the car and everything is fine.

But I still can't break out of the cycle of this debilitating thinking pattern.

I ike driving and have to drive to my workplace 

I have gotten rid of my last two cars because of my distorted thinking and I thought things would be better this time but it still the same.

I don't know how to break out of this cycle ",anxiety,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525
My Anxiety Stems From Self Hatred,"Hey so I'm a 20 y/o woman who just realized the root of my anxiety. Some background, my mom is a hoarder (who made us live in extreme unsanitary conditions for years) and my dad used to be extremely strict, they are divorced. I just wrote this journal entry out and felt compelled to share so this might help someone else.

I believed that the way that my mom made us live was a reflection of who I was as a person/ my self worth. If I was able to live in such a horrible debauched environment and be ok with it, then I was no better than the person who put me there. My failure and inability to clean it up or fix the problem solidified the fact that I deserved it. Because if It didn't then I would have been able to fix it. To call for help. No self respecting person would willingly live like that would they? They wouldn’t. That’s maybe the reason I feel so comfortable with my family as well. Because we were all in the same boat. And I was the one who did the most. Who got cps called. So I’m a little better then them right. 
But even then. The reason I wanted to call cps was because I thought my sister deserved better than that. Not that I deserved better but my sister. And also because I didn’t want to suffer anymore. I felt so selfish thinking that. That I didn’t want to suffer. That I didn’t want to go home. That I hated living like that even though I believed I deserved it. For not being better. 
I realize a lot of my self hatred comes from thinking I should be different than I am. I imagine the people I admire knowing exactly what to do in those situations. They wouldn’t have waited years to do what was right. I also feel so much shame that my sister had to live through that. I could have helped her sooner but I didn’t. That’s why I want to isolate so bad, I hate the thought of people seeing through me and seeing everything I hate about myself and what I allowed to happen. And it gets easier when I’m put together (for example, like not looking tired/ having nice clothes on) because I believe I have a shield that people can’t see through, but it’s hard when you can scrutinize every part of your appearance and personality to find flaws. It’s so easy to interpret people’s behavior as a personal attack on yourself when you think like this. This is also coupled with the fact that I didn’t have many close friends in childhood, had really bad social anxiety and got punished harshly for wrongdoings at home. I don’t feel safe when I’m not with my family or people I’ve confided in, even though my family are the ones who let me down the most.
But I want to feel safe because I want to live my life. I don’t want to do everything scared. I want to feel ok. I want to feel normal, unafraid, safe. But I don’t. And I hate it so much. I also attribute a lot of the friends that I have now to my efforts to fix myself, so I don’t feel completely comfortable around them either. I feel like if I’m around them too much they will see me and realize that I’m not worth talking to. 
My question is how do I stop thinking like this. I realize it's not a healthy mindset but how to I fix it? Please any help is appreciated

I feel lost.,"I feel lost

I'm (23m) currently in the United States military and hit my 5th year in July. I never struggled with anxiety or social anxiety until ~2nd year in. I'm not sure where it came from. I have no combat experience or had involvement in any real high stress situations. My anxiety usually flares up when I'm in public (i.e. crowded restraunts, stores, loud areas, etc), but especially formal military events like formations. The way I could explain it is like an elephant sitting on my chest. I feel like I can't breathe, I feel like I'm going to be sick, and I just want to tear myself out of my own skin. It feels like my fight or flight response goes off during these things, and I think it's because I'm supposed to be at the position of attention, not allowed to move in any way. It's the worst feeling I've ever had in my entire life. Because of this, I've grown more introverted. When I'm not working, I'm at home. I struggle to leave my home, and regularly disappoint my co-workers who want to go to bars or restaurants on weekends. I'm usually the butt of jokes because of this.

I've been through 2 therapists already, and am struggling to get mine changed again because I feel like no progress is being made. I've seen both therapists for more than three months each. Its been a hassle to get my therapists changed (military mental health care is terrible), and now I've been catching flak at work because of my anxiety. My boss (been in a year longer than me, no combat experience) pretty much told me he believes that my anxiety isnt real (I have an official diagnosis) and that I'm using it as an excuse to get out of things like formations, but that is the farthest from the truth. I've explained that I didn't ask to be this way, that I wouldn't be medicated just to keep up with a lie, and that I wouldn't have countless hours talking to therapists just so I wouldn't have to go to a fucking twenty minute formation.

I'm sick and tired of feeling this way. I'm sick and tired of being the butt of jokes because my co-workers don't have to deal with anxiety in their lives. I'm honestly hurt by the fact that my boss thinks I'm faking because we're pretty good friends, and have had talks about my issues in the past. I don't know what to do. I just don't want to feel this way.",anxiety,,the United States,36.13373245,-80.27826363584532
AI and love,"Heya. Is romantic love as we know it about to change forever? If it hasn't already, I guess.

Anxiety with sounds or movement — anyone else?,"Wondering if this is anxiety or a phobia or something else entirely.

I’ve suffered my whole life with a weird aversion to loud sounds and movement. I freak out when the room shakes from someone jumping too hard, or when a door slams shut. I also hate swings, or anything pendulum-like. I have a fear of punching bags or anything that could swing and hit something else. I hate strong winds or vibrations from loud music. I get anxiety just thinking about playing music too loud and my neighbours hearing it. I also hate the sound the door makes when it’s ajar and it keeps bumping against the doorframe. Absolutely despise wind chimes and I particularly hate hearing noise through a wall, like banging or something I can’t identify. Not a fan of boats because of the swaying, and I can’t watch videos of boats in rough seas without my anxiety spiking. I could go on, but you get the picture.

It’s usually ok if I’m the one making the noise, because I can control it.

Some of these things I’ve had since early childhood, others developed later on or got worse as I got older. 

Does anyone else suffer from this? Does it have a name? Is there anything that can help me?

Also worth mentioning I was recently diagnosed with ADHD—could the two be linked?

Here I am again I thought it was over.,"A while ago I posted here talking about having health anxiety well eventually it faded for a while but came back worse. 

Long story short I was having a bad case of allergies but I wasn’t aware I even had allergies that bad so first thing that came to mind was “oh I probably have pneumonia” so I got freaked out.

Basically I ended up struggling to breathe from a mix of a panic attack and allergies and called a ambulance they broke it down for me and said I was fine I took some allergy medicine and a shower and I immediately felt better but I visited the hospital anyways since they said it’s better to be sure than to stay in fear.

Got checked by a cheap doctor at first and they said my heart was abnormal which made me literally burst into tears practically I was telling my mom I didn’t wanna die (I’m 19 turning 20 by the way) but yeah I went to a real doctor and got an X-ray and they said I was doing perfectly fine and my heart and lungs were in “excellent condition” I needed to just take breathers from time to time.

Well since then I’ve kept my anxiety low until lately my tooth cracked open and got a cavity now it’s infected and my gums are turning red and I have severe dentist anxiety.

Basically when I was 15 I had a tooth break open and it needed removed but it wouldn’t numb because it was infected but instead of rescheduling for anesthesia or anything they just ripped it out anyways and said it was “my fault”. 

I don’t go to that dentist anymore but I’ve been so I guess mentally distraught from it that I haven’t wanted to go to a dentist again ever.

Now another tooth has broken open and I am gonna schedule an appointment but I’m so afraid I’ll have to endure that pain again I don’t know what to do.",anxiety,,anesthesia,36.253332650000004,-86.68369799094495
Struggle,"I am 19M and have been struggling with anxiety for years but surgery brought it out. Despite being quite an outgoing guy I deep down have anxiety. I’ve had body dysmorphia due to pectus excavatum which often made me feel like I was ugly but also being a virgin made me feel like people would judge me at every social gathering I go to. This was my starting problem but was further expanded once I got circumcised in January. This meant I had to stay indoors in my accommodation (which is already quite antisocial) which meant my social interaction was reduced massively. I ended up sitting inside playing video games ignoring my uni work and started feeling really bad about myself (which I still feel is completely fair as what I was doing was lazy and bad) but then my anxiety started kicking in badly. I stopped going in to university once my surgery was complete, removing my good friends close to me from my life, and started feeling really depressed. Over the next month I couldn’t bring myself to go in, stopped speaking to my parents unless they got worried, only spoke to my friends when I was playing games online (no personal chats) and most importantly stopped the biggest thing in my life which is playing football/soccer. It was only a few weeks when I started hating myself and telling myself I was a bum and a failure thinking my life was truly over. I then got a message from my uni telling me I would be kicked off if I didn’t respond to the head of my course….. I didn’t respond. I had got such bad anxiety that I couldn’t even talk to the people that wanted to know exactly how I was feeling. As a little break from my sadness I went back to my hometown Newcastle to watch my favourite football team win their first trophy in 70 years with my mates, balled my eyes out, hugged random men and had a great time but all it did was put a break in my sorrows. About 5 days later I lay in bed and imagined killing myself. And it felt freeing. I’m genuinely shocked by this because I am on the outside the most happy person but was blinded by my own persona. I think I need help but thought this was the best place to go. I love life, love my parents and love my friends but my life is now at a standstill I need help from outsiders.

Also— has anyone else experienced a major increase in anxiety or onset of new anxiety symptoms after a surgery or anesthesia? In particular, lightheadedness was never one of my anxiety symptoms before, but I know that it can be related to anxiety.",anxiety,,anesthesia,36.253332650000004,-86.68369799094495
Reglan changed my life for the absolute worst!,"2019 I started writing this:

I wanted to share my story at Rosewood Adolescence in Wickenburg Arizona. Worst expierence of my life and put me on Reglan! 

It has taken me years to get back to function normally, and I’m still suffering from anxiety and depression that developed from the time I was there. I am now 22 years old.
 I never expiernced any form of anxiety and depression until this experience on drug called reglan.
 While I was at Rosewood I had severe constipation for all my days there, and the staff did nothing to help me. I could barely move. My stomach was fully distended and throbbing with pain. And the staff and nurses said keep eating and push through. 
I felt like going insane I could barely move it felt like my body was weighing down. Finally they approved a medication after a month! It was called Reglan for constipation. I never heard of it but they said it was safe!?!?
 They give to many kids. So they gave it to me to take 3 times a day. 
Little did I know it was an antipsychotic drug!  They didn’t tell me anything about the drug. As the day passed by there was something off
with my mind and body, I felt  so restless and didn’t know what to do with myself and as the day moved on I couldn’t stop shaking, the staff did absolutely nothing and said your fine your just haven’t a panic attack just to sit still. 

I have never had a panic attack before in my life. The thing was it wasn’t a “panic attack” it was a horrific reaction to a drug!!!! but they didn’t let me know that what was happening to me ! I was the most scared I have ever been in my entire life. I physically couldn’t think. My  body took control, my whole upper body was tremoring. As soon as I took Reglan my whole perspective on the world changed. I couldn’t sit still. I was crawling out of my own skin. Thinking about it hurts my brain, it was the most confusing and Scariest moment of my life. I wanted to die! I felt nauseous and sick all of the above.  My mind was worrying what everyone was thinking about me!?!? The feelings kept getting worse and worse…..
 
I I just wanted my body to be flat and I wanted to be dead . I wanted to be injected with something to knock me out. This was the worst thing a human could expiernce. It was an indescribable feeling that I’m trying to put words too, but frustrates me because I can’t.

  I asked to sit down which they wouldn’t let me. I looked like I was going crazy. I stepped outside and asked the nurse to put me in a cold room, just lie down. 
She said no you can’t . So I went back inside where all the kids were on the coach. I took up the whole couch with my body I felt like I was dying spinning and my my mind was itching if that makes sense. I was uncomfortable and terrified and I felt dead and like my whole body couldn’t stop moving . I went into the nurse and  asked them to do something to help anything that was happening I was confused lost. 

They should have called 911 but they just sat there. I called my my mom and screamed I didn’t know what I was saying lost confused screaming crying. Then I called my therapist at rosewood and she said “calm down your having a panick attack”! They said go to bed. I wanted to SCREAM. I thought to my self how am I going to go to bed?The thought of laying down felt so horrible I wanted to die pass out kill myself ANYTHING. I stayed up all night with my body uncontrollably shaking and all my muscles tightened  and hurt like I was being punched .My roommate was sleeping, while I felt like I was slowly dying.  The staff were inexperienced and very dismissive of what was happening to me. 

This drug I have no words for. 7 years later I am continuing to push through the pain but suffer from all the side effects and an altered brain and will be going forward with ketamine treatment, and hopefully that will help me feel some peace. ",anxiety,,Wickenburg,33.9680962,-112.730135

Called 911 for panic attack and feel so embarassed,"I have had diagnosed anxiety for almost 10 years now and have had panic attacks before but I forgot to take one of my meds this morning and when you miss a dose it can make your heart rate higher, and took adderall this afternoon for ADHD planning on doing school work, but once it kicked in I noticed my resting heart rate was high in the 120s. I sat there trying to calm down but it kept increasing all the way up to 180 and all of a sudden I couldn't catch my breath and didn't know what to do and started feeling dizzy so I called 911... the firefighters showed up first and they were nice but I could tell they were kind of skeptical, but once the paramedics showed up they left and the paramedics were super nice about it... they checked my vitals and helped me slow my heart rate some back to the 110s and told me since my vitals were stable I was ok unless I wanted to go to the ER which I definitely did not and they left. I just feel so stupid and like I wasted resources for people who really need them, especially the firefighters. I am so embarrassed I don't even want to tell anyone in my life and I live in an apartment complex so I know all my neighbors hears and saw the ambulance and fire truck...",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668

How long did it take for you to accept that panic attacks were just that 'panic attacks',"As the title says. For those in here who have panic or anxiety attacks. How long and what did it take for you to accept there wasn't anything physically wrong with you.

My story in short:

I had my panic attacks emerge with a major one 1,5 years ago which made me think I was dying and have had them ever since. Only now I am starting to accept that it is nothing physically wrong with me.


So obviously since I thought I was dying I got tested:
Holter, Heart echo, Stress test, abdominal echo, colonoscopy, Brain mri, asthma tests. Multiple visits to ER, countless bloodworks and ecgs later all that was found was that I have mild fatty liver.

What made it worse for me was hearing about those odd cases where people were diagnosed with 'panic' and had something bigger going on. Of course I thought I was one of those because the symptoms were horrible.

So yeah starting to finally accept that yes the mind can trigger some big physical events. And it's amazing already what just accepting them has done to diminish them in severity.

Yeah and i'm all in on health anxiety thats causing my issues.",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
Why am I getting unprovoked anxiety?,"2 days ago  I went to ER with anxiety and chest pressure. All tests came back normal and I was told that I had anxiety attack. 

The past 2 weeks I wake up with unprovoked anxiety.  As soon as I take my morning glass of water my anxiety intensifies and I get upset stomach. 

I usually don’t eat until 1100 and that when I take my meds: Lisinopril, Metrolpolol, and Zoloft along with some vitamins/supplements. 

I go for a walk after eating and often feel lightheaded. 

My Bp, pulse, and other vitals are normal, but I can hear my heartbeat in my ears. 

I know I’ve been under a lot of stress. I’m between jobs, a death in the family, and my sister whom I am very close to was in ICU after having a heart attack after giving birth. I’ve tried Cog Behavioral Therapy and counseling over the past 2 years. I have a history of 2 heart ablations for abnormal heart rhythms and SIBO, and I’m a 50 year old male. I’ve been tested for Carcinoid and came back negative. 

Is my vagus nerve messed up? My symptoms seem to get better by the late afternoon/ evening. 

I don’t understand why this is happening and it’s ruining my quality of life. ",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668

"Shock, vibrations, needles. Does anyone else feel like this?","'m new to this—it's been less than a year since I was diagnosed with anxiety. So far, I've had two episodes. The episodes themselves didn’t last long, but the ""aftereffects"" did, and they never really went away.

The first time, I thought I was going to die from a heart attack. I went to the doctor, got tests done, and everything was fine. The chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath eventually passed.

This time, though, I’ve been feeling muscle pain, fatigue, palpitations (these are getting better), and I developed trigger fingers in both hands in the morning, which improve as the day goes on. Sometimes my tongue tingles or vibrates, and every now and then, I feel a sharp, needle-like pain somewhere. I also have a lot of joint pain and a slight electric shock sensation in the soles of my feet when walking. Does anyone else feel like this?

I keep trying to tell myself it’s just my anxiety messing with my body, but deep down, I’m scared... You know how it is.",anxiety,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
I need to be talked down. I am freaking out,"I am 29 F, I suffer from anxiety and depression, I’m on zoloft. I just started my health journey to eat better but this has only been my second day. For the last couple weeks I have been getting these random sharp pains in my chest, on the left side near my heart. Two days ago I had jaw pain. I googled it and google SUCKS. It made my anxiety worse as it said it symptoms in women for a heart attack are what I just described. I did not realize until just now that symptoms can last weeks to months before the actual event and now i’m shaking, nauseous, ran to my safe place which is my bed and i can’t stop crying. I haven’t been eating the healthiest, I don’t get much exorcise. I am a hypochondriac. I send myself in and out of the ER. My last ER visit which was 4 months ago everything was normal. They ran blood tests, EKG. They said I was healthy and there were no red flags. They also listened to my heart and said it sounds normal. I know I can’t keep going to the ER for every problem as I am i frequent flyer but this is freaking me out. In the past year I’ve been to the ER more than 15 times and it’s always the same thing. Everything is normal and I’m healthy. I don’t have health insurance and the ER is not cheap as yall know. So, here we go again. I feel like it’s always something with me and I’m driving myself crazy. If anyone else has experienced this please tell me about your experience. I’m not doing ok right now. ",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
Pain and overall discomfort in body,"I know this post is gonna be long, but I hope you will still read it and support me since I really need someone to comfort me and give me some advice.   
  
**Disclaimer**: I have to let you know that I am dealing with what I would consider as pretty bad health anxiety. My biggest concern atm health wise is having fibromyalgia, and therefore, this is the only time I am going to mention this condition. I would prefer if you will respect that and not mention this condition either, since it is a **BIG** trigger for me. Thank you in advance. 

I am making this post with the **biggest** hope of finding people who also either suffer or have suffered with the same symptoms as I am experiencing at the moment. Or at least some of the symptoms.   
  
I will try to make this short, but for most of my life (I am turning 30 next month) I have been struggling with anxiety, stress and depression. I have had many different both physical and psychological symptoms over the years that comes and goes. I am not going to go into details about these symptoms, because they do not scare me anymore, since I know they come from anxiety and stress.

In December 2023 I started to have a pain in my left knee, after I had been working out for about half a year. It got so bad, that I was not able to do cardio or work out my legs anymore. I thought I had to take a break and then it would all disappear after it got some rest. But I could not stop hyper fixating on it since I really loved to work out, and it stopped me from doing it. After some months, I also started to having trouble walking properly, because my legs and body in generel felt too stiff, and the knee kept hurting. I went to the doctor and they told me nothing was wrong with me, after doing some tests. I could not believe them and I kept spiralling around about my health, and was scared I was starting to develop MS or some other bad condition. I kept googling and googling. They told me there was no signs of these conditions. I then went on vacation I had planned with a friend, and the symptoms was not noticeable when I was there. ""Just"" the normal anxiety symptoms. They then came back and I started to hyper fixating again.   
  
At this time, I was also seeing a psychiatrist to find the right anxiety meds for me. He wanted me to stop the meds I was taking at that time, because I had some heart palpitations that potentially could be caused by the meds. I also did not feel like it was working properly. It was Venlafaxine and I only got a couple of weeks to get off it. He said there shouldn't really be much withdrawal symptoms from going off of them that fast, because I did not get a high dose. But hell yeah, there was. Everything got even worse because of that. I started to experiencing anxiety attacks I had never experienced before.   
  
I played a lot of video games to pass time. The knee pain somehow disappeared and then I started to feel pain in both hands. I then thought I started to develop tendinitis from gaming for many hours. But even after weeks of rest, my hands and arms would still hurt. Then my back also started to hurt bad. I went to the doctor again and they told me there was nothing to see but sent me to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist told me there was nothing wrong with me, but my body was really stiff and tense. They would not send me to and MRI because they said there was nothing wrong. I could NOT believe it, since the pain got worse and worse. Then I started to believe I was having a disc herniation, and the pain started to get worse in my lower back where I was believing I had it. I was so scared, and chose to pay for a MRI myself. I got my whole back scanned and the results also came back clear. After I got the result I got so sad, because I really hoped they would find something so they could help me relieve this pain. In the meantime, my psychiatrist prescribed me some new anxiety meds, and after about a week, almost ALL my pain disappeared. I was HAPPY. I started to believe the pain could be from anxiety or stress since they disappeared after I saw nothing really was wrong with me physically, and the meds also calmed me down. It was up to this Christmas (2024) and I had about 3-4 weeks without pain. Then a couple of days before Christmas the pain started to lurk up on me again. It was in my whole body again. They went on for about a month or so, and then I started trying to find answers on Youtube. I found a video explaining how anxiety could manifest in such symptoms as I was/am experiencing. The video was a big relief and it made me so much more calm. The following day the symptoms disappeared again. I was AGAIN convinced, YEAH this MUST be anxiety! They went away for a couple of weeks.... And again, yeah, AGAIN they came back. Then I read some posts here on Reddit about people experiencing some kind of the same symptoms, but I am having a hard time believing it still :( Now I feel like I cannot find anything to really relieve it like I did before. 

**The pain and other symptoms I am experiencing right now 24/7 is:**  
\- Burning pain/skin  
\- Some days really bad soreness and ache like I have been working out hard the day before, especially in my buttocks  
\- Feeling bruised  
\- Sensitive skin  
\- A pulsating feeling in my whole body  
\- Heart palpitations  
\- Shortness of breath  
\- Stiffness in whole body  
\- Stabbing pain in different areas sometimes  
\- Flu-like symptoms when I have been doing too much in a day   
\- My hands and feet feels like if they are almost asleep, and you know when you have hit your elbow against an object and it gives you that weird pain through the arm
\- When I lift up my arms they start to fall asleep in a short amount of time
\- No strength 

Some days the pain is a 4-5 and on the worst they are a solid 10 - and it is really hard to cope anymore. Pain meds does not work. The pain is moving around my whole body and can switch from second to second. 

So, have anyone else experienced this and if so, how did you overcome it? Can it really be caused by anxiety and stress? I really need light in these dark times. So some good stories or something would be really appreciated. It is very hard for me to believe it. Why won't it just disappear again????

I am SO sad and at my lowest point in life right now.

Thank you.

Hypoglycemic symptoms,"I get some heart pounding, muscle tension, never really true panic - but a whole host of other symptoms. But my biggest issue when i have an anxiety flare up is sleep issues which only worsen things. And the sleep issues are often caused or worsened by these hypoglycemic like symptoms.  I’ll eat something and within a few hours I will be incredibly hungry but also sweating, stomach pain, anxiety etc. and although i wont have much of an appetite many of those symptoms will disappear as soon as I eat something. But its the worst at night.  Ill finally get some sleep but ill wake up a few hours later with anxiety, stomach pains and hungry as hell and unable to fall back asleep. If I force myself to eat something it relieves much of the symptoms, but often ill have enough adrenaline still coursing through me that i cant fall back asleep.

Help needed with on going post-break up Anxiety.,"Hey Reddit.

This might be a long one. Firstly 37 M, I am medically diagnosed and treated with GAD for the last 12 years.

I was in a relationship for the past 16 months. Things were going good.

A month ago I caught my partner (31 M) lying to me about where they were (Share my location on iPhone and finding out they were at a hotel), I confronted them and they ended up admitting that they may have caught feelings for someone else, which included just a kiss at party event during a drug fueled state 2-3 weeks prior. This person was with them at the time, which they confirmed was just to set boundaries due to what happened at the party.

They never told me about the kiss, nor did they tell me about the hotel. When he messaged me that day, he said he was feeling sick and heading home to have an early night, then we spoke around the time he was driving to the hotel and told me he was driving home. Then sent me our usual love you goodnight messages, it was in replying to that I saw the location.  
I only found out about the hotel when he said the following day that he had another night booked.

At first we broke it off, then I said I wanted to work on the relationship.  
3 weeks ago I decided to bite the bullet, and he explained a few more things to me, but ended up putting things on a break, no contact, no social media etc. (we tried this last week, but they wouldn’t respect my boundaries and apologised for this later on). They have also been stressed and worried as they know what this has done to me mentally.

The same evening, my housemate messaged my ex and the other guy, asking questions. My ex cracked and said that he could not see a future with me as he wouldn’t feel comfortable being around my housemate in future and I said I don’t think I could trust anything he said ever again.

We blocked each other on social media, I archived some Instagram photos etc. He ended up getting the guy to block me, block my housemate and my best friend (who had nothing to do with any of this).

A few days after he ended up posting on Instagram with a summer album and a bunch of photos tagging the guy along with selfies of both of them.

10 days ago, he made contact via text, asking if I was doing any better. I ended up blocking his number.

They have been hanging out together every weekend since.

There has been a lot of inconsistencies with the whole situation. I originally met him when he was on a break with his ex and when I friend-zoned him, he got back with his ex, then we started seeing each other and they were on a break again. This happened a few times as I friend zoned him a few times, because my gut was telling me something was off. He has never said one nice thing about any of his ex boyfriends.  
He managed to get me to block people on FB that I have known for years, because they were related to one of his ex's.

On Valentines day he had to be home at an earlier time as he had a Valentines Day tradition with his mum where they would go out for coffee cake etc, however the year before we hung out till late and he has never mentioned this tradition.

He used to stay at this guys place in the spare room and they would hang out during the end of December and Jan, he would hire a hotel cause it was cheaper than paying for an Uber in and out of town. No invites to me, as I had work the next day most of those times.  
Also on Valentine’s Day he asked me to turn my insta on private, because apparently his school kids were looking at profiles and making comments. The day he posted the summer photo album, his Instagram went public (back to private now).  
Every time we would post stories of us on his Insta, he would only post them to close friends, this started in January 2025. The last time he posted a photo of both of us on SM was in late last year.

Last Saturday I re-connected with one of our mutual contacts, who stopped talking to me for no reason. He ended up admitting that they had sex multiple times (provided with photo evidence) 4 months into our relationship. He told this guy that we were in an open relationship and that I would not care. Then things got weird and he asked this guy not to talk to me.  
Even more context, when we first got together, I wanted to try an open relationship and he said he was not comfortable with this. We agreed that we would stay closed until we both were ready.  
I did not cheat once.

I feel like everything that is happening since a month ago, has made my anxiety and depression spiral. Every time I start getting a bit better, something new comes up (like last Saturday) and it increases it all again. I keep thinking about him and it hurts and my anxiety goes up. My appetite still hasn’t fully come back and I am sleeping 5.5-6 hours a night, compared to my usual 8.  
Is this normal? Will my sleep and appetite return as I heal?

Should I also confront him? or keep him deleted out of my life? I don't think he will ever be honest with me, considering he was so ""happy"" throughout the relationship.    
I keep thinking of how many other guys there might have been. All the red flags I could have missed.

Happy to answer any questions relating to this.

I have been walking daily, going to work, meditating daily, no caffeine and recently stopped drinking my regular 1-2 glasses of wine. Any help or pointers on dealing with this, the anxiety and anything is much appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",anxiety,,Anxiety,41.7783192,-88.12142139851719

Anxiety attack after argument at hotel front desk—is this response normal?,"
I asked for information on an event in town in Las Vegas and got frustrated the concierge didn’t know what I was talking about and raised my voice, and was a bit rude. 

He walked away to go find the information for me but never came back after 25 minutes. I’m now wondering if I am banned or in trouble now? 

I even had an anxiety attack at the counter and my friend yelled at me for falling apart. Let me explain

I was very polite to the lady asking for information from me while I was in line, but she was rude. My friend I was with said she was rude since I asked so passively.

The guy at the desk was extremely nice but I went out of my way to be rude to him because I felt being nice I was too “passive” and weak (as my friend told me) and I needed to be more assertive since my friend gets angry at me for being so weak and we have major fights.

I felt horrible because he went out of his way to be kind and I went out of my way to be rude to him. He walked away and never came back so I don’t know if he told the hotel to ban me for life or he just left me hanging…

Yes I know what I did was being a prick and I’m normally 99 times out of 100 the nice one. I just didn’t wanna fight with my friend again since usually the fights are explosive. And I tried Google but I got conflicting reports

Poor guy didn’t deserve that. 

But two main things 

1) My fingers started shaking violently while I was waiting. Why did that happen? Was that indeed from an anxiety attack 

2) How do I become assertive without being “weak and too friendly” or “too rude and mean”? 

Thank you ",anxiety,,Las Vegas,36.2533896,-115.2794366262601
Dealing with Physical Symptoms Everyday,"In 2 weeks I (28F) will complete my 6 month journey with anxiety. I am not on medication, and I’ve only used Xanax a couple of times in the beginning.

It all began while I was at work, I had a full blown panic attack and felt like I was about to die, ended up in the ER and then was fine to continue about my day a few hours later. This happened a few more times, then I decided to take a break from work (5 weeks) to see if I can be at ease. It was actually worse, I started spiraling from being alone. I started seeing a therapist and doing things that could benefit me like yoga, meditation, drawing, reading.

Eventually I returned to work and full blown panic attacks were gone, just small ones here and there. But the thing that is really killing me are the physical symptoms that have come with it. Every week or 2 it’s something different, lately it’s been a lot of disassociation and feeling off balance. Today while I was driving, it felt like my brain on fire for like a few minutes and my eyes wanted to lose focus, but I did do a good job grounding myself. 

I want it to end and I know it’s not a fast process. I definitely don’t want to go on medication. So I’m hoping to see if there is anyone  with a similar experience like me and if there is any advice. Would highly appreciate it, thanks.",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
Phantosmia?,"(18F) - diagnosed generalised anxiety disorder at 8. OCD diagnosis at 14. Not on any medications. 

Hi, I’m a little freaked out right now because over the last 3 months I smell what I can only describe as campfire smoke intermittently at random points. It mostly happens at night I’ve noticed, sometimes when I’m exercising/walking, sometimes when I’m in bed. It only lasts a second or so, and only when inhaling. My nose also feels warm for a second (not sure if I’m imagining that part)

I’m a little anxious as I went down the rabbit hole of searching it up and of course the first thing that appears is ‘brain tumour’ - so not exactly thrilled about the prospect of that. 

My OCD and anxiety symptoms have been under control for over a year now. I hadn’t actually experienced an anxiety attack in over a year before this last December just gone. I had a weird, unprovoked panic attack that lasted around half an hour. Cut to a few weeks later, in January I started getting this weird smoke smell. It happens at completely random times, and is always a campfire smoke smell. It lasts less than a second. It’s really worrying me now.

I saw a doctor and he said he wasn’t too worried, but I’m not too sure. 

I also have other symptoms like muscle weakness in one side, some feelings of pressure or heaviness in my cheekbones, jaw, arms, thighs. 

Also a new symptom: really bad tension headaches? They manifest differently - sometimes it’s tightness on my scalp, sometimes shooting pains in temples, pain on top of head, dull pain behind my right eye. It doesn’t usually get worse with movement/coughing and usually improves after taking Ibuprofen. No vomiting etc.

I feel like the fact I’ve had my anxiety under control for so long it makes these symptoms a manifestation of anxiety unlikely? I mean, I don’t just get phantosmia when I’m anxious, I can be doing literally anything. Can anxiety cause physical issues without an actual fear/state of panic?

"Xanax, Klonopin, Valium","I’m prescribed clonazepam 1mg 3x a day for panic disorder I have severe anxiety and get seizures. The thing is 3mg clonazepam may be a lot for people for me it’s not that much. I recently got 1mg Xanax and 10mg Valium and I noticed that one the Xanax helped me so much quicker than be clonazepam. It made me chill and I was able to work much better the next day I took the Valium and for me it was even make chill. I was so calm although I think I needed more -like 60mg6 tablets 

I don’t know what to do and don’t wanna tell my doc I tried other medications in the same drug category 

Any suggestions? Do you prefer any of these medications? ",anxiety,,Xanax,41.2362104,42.8453768
Panic attack caused a fainting fit,"Has anyone else has had a fainting fit/ seizure because of panic attacks and if you have, how have you dealt with them?


In December I had a panic attack on the train. There were multiple reasons for it to have started and it might have even been the combination of everything that was happening. 
I was reading a book and the main charcter was being put to death by lethal injection, very uncomfortable topic for me because I have a fear of needles and the scene was pretty intense. Being December also meant the trains heating was turned all the way up and it was around 5 so everyone was rushing home, so on top of my phobia being triggered, it was also hot and crowded. 
At first I put my book down and tried to distract myself but suddenly felt dizzy and claustrophobic, with a intense growing sense of panic. When I realised it wasn't just going to go away, I thought standing by the train doors and getting some fresh air as they opened might help but it got worse. 
It went from me wanting to be by the doors, to me thinking I should call someone to pick me up, to me alerting the nearest stranger that I was going to pass out.

I had some crazy dreams all whilst feeling like my body was in a tornado, then woke up on the train floor as my vision and hearing slowly cane back to me. 
A crowd was gathered around me and a few people sat on the floor with me checking that I was okay. The rest is a blur but the people who were on the floor helped me get off and helped me call a family member to come pick me up. 
I'm honestly so grateful for everyone's sympathy and kindness I don't know what would've happened to me otherwise. <3<3
One of the people who had been helping me was actually a nurse who asked me a bunch of questions I don't really remember, but also asked if I wanted an ambulance. 
This next part is no one's fault, literally just a 'in the confusion of the moment' situation.
Partly because I was completely out of it and because the nurse didn't seem too pushy for me to call one, I said no to an ambulance. Looking back I realise that I might have said something that implied I had fainting fits regularly and that's why she didn't call one on my behalf, thinking I might be diabetic or something.

I got home safe and have booked an appointment at the hospital since then. Haven't had another seizure, and was able to get on the train just fine until I had two panic attacks a month ago and haven't been able to get on the train since.
I would appreciate any helpful tips to deal with panic attacks that are triggered by feeling trapped, as the train is the only way I get to my college. Thanks for reading. ",anxiety,,phobia,48.8351638,2.3609876
pregnancy and panic attacks,"I’m currently 36 weeks pregnant and I have been having panic attacks almost daily. The kind of panic attacks that send you to the ER because they don’t stop. About a month ago I had two really bad panic attacks at work that left me agoraphobic. I can’t be home alone, drive alone, barely leave my house for appointments. My psychiatrist said that this is more than likely due to my hormones and once I deliver baby, I should begin to feel a little better. I have TRIED to talk to my OB and they keep telling me that it is out of their realm.. they can’t induce me early due to panic disorder. They are so insensitive to how I am feeling. I lay in bed all day right now waiting for her to come out so that way I can hopefully regain some of my life back. I’ve never felt like this in my life and it’s hard to even find the words to describe how I’m feeling. 

My partner also doesn’t understand anxiety and is not supportive at all. He thinks I’m overreacting anytime I say I need to go in. He prioritizes himself first over myself and baby and I would not of seen him being like this a few months ago. I feel like my anxiety is ruining our relationship or maybe just showing his true colors/how he handles very difficult situations. 

I’m just so lost in a person I don’t recognize right now. ",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
Anxious after getting back together,"me (F20) and my Bf (M23) broke up the other day. (together 7 months) we we were both very emotional in the moment and in the midst of it all we just decided we shouldn't be together. It wasn't a decision either of us wanted and through both of our tears was still telling eachother how much we loved one another but the emotions of the moment just seemed to lead to it.

the next morning he messaged me apologising for the previous evening and how he regretted everything and visa versa. He drove down shortly after and we had a very long discussion about what happened and what a rushed, emotional decision it was and how we would avoid that again in the future, communication and avoiding just building things up until they explode

Whilst reconciling it really felt like we understood eachother and how much each of our past relationships had affected the decisions we had made that evening and it felt like a really in depth, meaningful conversation where we straightened everything out and was able to talk about each of our feelings from that evening and it felt amazing to discuss it and understand eachothers thoughts

However, ever since getting back together i just feel incredibly anxious? i just wonder if this is normal for me to feel and if anyone else has had this and how they overcame it. i find myself incredibly anxious over things i never really thought about before such as his reply times and i find myself overthinking everything.

TLDR: is anxiety after getting back together normal even if we were broken up a matter of hours? ",anxiety,,M23,34.6460783,135.5152725
Do you notice that pregabaline (lyrica) is working ?,"I got it prescribed for anxiety. And I think I still take a low dosage but I read on here how people notice it working after idk an hour after taking. 

I take 100mg in the morning and then 2 more times 50mg each. 
I can’t tell if it helps or not sometimes I forget to take it but I don’t really notice a difference. 

I feel like the meds I’ve tried that give me no side effects like lyrica also have no effect. 

Meds like fluoxetine gave me so many side effects that I felt even worse and wanted to 💀myself. Same with sertraline. 
Hated wellbutrine because I felt so unmotivated and tired + the 15 other side effects. 
Tianeptine gave me no side effects but again no effect.
Deanxit (flupentixol, melitracen) no side effects but I felt like it didn’t do anything
Xanax also didn’t really work? Still had panic attacks and really bad anxiety but caused derealization and like I got a little tired.

I feel like I’m sensitive to meds because I get so many persistent side effects (tried a few others but they were for insomnia, like trazdone, mirtazepine, mianserine) but they also all gave me side effects

That’s why I really want pregabaline to work, I have no side effects but at the same time idk if I does anything ",anxiety,,lyrica,2.70332775,101.89696225684615

Why didn’t you fix it?’
2.	⁠I was playing with his dog at his house and he told me to play in a different way bc it’s how the dog likes it (the dog was playing just fine)
3.	⁠I washed my face and didn’t have my contacts in and made a mess and couldn’t see it  (again I live alone in my own house he doesn’t live with me)  and he made a comment about ‘wow there’s lot of water in here it looks like a water park’ and I took that as he was calling me a slob.
4.	⁠we were having a conversation and he told me how he forgot to text his friend which he started doing and I was like ‘it’s okay’ and he was like ‘yea I just forgot what do you mean by ‘it’s okay’ and I’m like I beat myself up a ton about forgetting things so I’m just reasuring you. He apologized and explained he understood but this isn’t the first time he’s been like ‘why’d you respond that way’

Is brain fog normal during recovery from chronic anxiety?,"Hey,

I've had a series of very stressful events that started in december. I think I've been in a state of hyperstimulation since because I haven't gotten a single panic attack since then yet I've felt ""wired"" nearly the entire time. 

Last thing that made me realize how bad things were getting are these sunburn sensations all over my body, but 90% of the time in my legs, Doctors say they fluctuate way too much in severity, areas, and timing to be any kind serious nerve damage and it has to be due to stress. They tend to disappear or nearly disappear when I'm distracted. They flare up when I'm stressed or thinking about them (such as right now). 

Last Friday I had one big cry and I finally went to ER to get put on a list to see a psychiatrist. That was the day I finally started accepting that these sensations have to do with stress/anxiety and that they're not part of something serious and permanent. 

The day after, saturday, I started getting this fuzzy/lightheadedness. I felt this weird dissociation yet I felt rather relaxed. My legs weren't bothering me as much. Cut to today, **I now have brain fog**. It's a little unnerving. My legs still seem to be getting better, but I'm a little bothered by this brain fog. Apart from the brain fog, I just feel a massive amount of mental fatigue, and a lot of physical fatigue in my face. It feels like a caffeine crash. 

  
Anyone ever experienced this after a period of chronic stress? I want to believe that my nervous system and brain are starting to chill a bit. ",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
Anxious about first seasonal job as a maintenence technician,"Hi there! I got a seasonal job outside of Denali Alaska doing maintenance. I am getting more and more anxious as it gets closer to time, not just because of a new experience, but on making friends, and being capable of doing my job. I havea year of  expierience in HVAC, with a lot of testing capacitors, contactors, installation, changing filters, cleaning coils and such. Just the basics. I also am good at woodworking, and have installed light switches and hanging lights before. I am worried that I'm going to be unqualified for the job, or getting put in a situation where I know little about it and cannot figure it out. I have been studying on drain cleanings, and toilet repairs, but I still don't have a full grasp of it. I'm regretting not doing a simpler job like housekeeping. I feel like I have some capabilities for the job but not enough. I don't want to cause issues for the company. I know its normal to be anxios for a job but I just don't want to be stressed while I am in such a gorgeous place. This job will rather push me to become better at fixing things or cause immense stress. I have always wanted to work in Alaska, let alone Denali where there is such a perethera of wildlife and beauty. 

Another is living with a roomate. I am excited to meet new people, I just hope I am accepted. I am neurodivergent, and have a history of not fitting in with people and being left out. I am hoping my love for nature will help me fit in. The last thing I want is to be left out of activities. Thank you for listening to me speaking my mind. If you have any guidance, I would much appreciate it.",anxiety,,Alaska,64.4459613,-149.680909
How do you manage your health anxiety?,"Hi everyone, 

I am a 30 year old male without a significant medical history or condition. I do suffer from health anxiety. It's a long story so buckle up. 

I had epigastric/slightly left abdominal discomfort for about 4 months. I thought it was pancreatic cancer. This prompted me to get tumor markers, which were all normal (CA19-9: 10 CEA < 2.0) like three times. CT scan (without contrast): Normal. MRI without contrast: normal. MRI with IV contrast: normal. Upper endoscopy found a 1cm hiatal hernia, that could be the cause of my discomfort. You would think all these normal findings would make it things better, but nope. Whenever I get pain or discomfort in that area, my mind immediately jumps to pancreatic cancer. 

For that matter, I relate any pain or discomfort to cancer. For example, I have a canker sore under my tongue. My mind jumped to oral cancer (I am not a heavy drinker or do I smoke). Couple of other cancer anxieties are lymphomas and leukemia. I get lightheaded? Leukemia. I kind of felt an imaginary bump? Lymphoma. So my mind is all over the place jumping from pancreatic cancer to leukemia, oral cancer to lymphoma. I know I am insane but I want to stop worrying. All of my blood tests are normal (ESR less than 1, CRP < 0.02 among other tests). 

I keep reading posts on here of people who were diagnosed with those cancers at young age and it makes me go crazy and makes me imagine the worse case scenarios, no matter how improbable they are. My mind goes to what if the radiologists missed something? I know I have hypochondriasis when I start to doubt medical results given my professionals.   
  
For those with health anxiety, especially with cancer,  how did you get out of it? ",anxiety,,hernia,32.51149573617983,-110.8438606392588
My anxiety/panic attacks are getting more frequent and I am freaking out,"I have always been an anxious person. Had anxious attacks before, years ago. But now, they’re something else! 
My dad suffered a ruptured aneurysm a month ago, this is when I found out it’s also genetic. I have been so anxious in regards to both my dad (who’s now doing good, thankfully) and me having one and not knowing! 
I had a bad panic attack 3 weeks ago where the ambulance was called for me. And every other day I am having palpitations, dissociating, that feeling in the stomach, can feel my heart in my throat, headaches, dizziness etc I want to know who has felt this before and it was actually anxiety. 
Cause I am having a hard time distinguishing from what’s anxiety/panic, thinking it could be something else more serious. 
I have propanalol who has been prescribed to me, and after the big attack that I had, my granny who lives in Brazil gave me a strip of her benzos to which we don’t have over here (Bromazepam). Would it be okay to take benzo and propanolol to help me. What have you guys done to help when the anxiety just doesn’t go away?   
I am waiting on a neuro consult due to the genetic part of my dads disease and this is killing me as it could take up to 2 years to be seen! 
Thanks guys and I am sorry if it doesn’t make sense, I am currently trying to stop an anxiety attack from coming on ",anxiety,,Brazil,-10.3333333,-53.2
Need Help! Tapering off Depratal 30mg,"Hey everyone, I need your guys expertise and knowledge.

I month my gp doctor asked about effectiveness and it doesn't worked immediately we switched Depratal 30mg and I live in Poland. At start I felt strange. Then after month it calmed down.

Random bouts of anxiety?,"Hello, everyone. 

I've been officially diagnosed with GAD and PD last year, after a very intense anxiety-filled summer. I've always been anxious, but it has progressively gotten worse - until I seeked help. I was put on 40 mg Prozac and have also started 50 mg Trazodone (for sleeping issues). 

The thing is.. I still feel anxious, almost every single day. It's like I'm anxious about something unknown, I get this feeling of impending doom, like something is about to happen. But I.. don't think about anything. There's literally nothing in my brain, it's just a physical feeling. I get nauseous, feeling like I'm about to pass out, scared that I'll have a panic attack - so I just pretty much throw myself into one.

This usually happens when I'm home (in a safe environment), and usually at night. Like I just.. don't get it. I don't even know what to do about it, because I don't get why it's happening. But it has been happening almost every day for a while now.",anxiety,,PD,45.391408,11.805848677115883

"Anxiety so bad I haven’t eaten in days, mom threatening to take me to the ER.","I caught some sort of bad common cold, urgent care said it wasn't the flu or covid. But I have bad stomach pains and bad acid reflux, and I’m terrified of throwing up. All culminating into panic and anxiety going without a meal for about five days now. No matter what I do, eating worsens the acid reflux, I’m so terrified.

I’ve managed goldfish crackers, cold tortillas, protein cheerios, even whole wheat bread and a little peanut butter.

But now my mom is threatening to take me to the ER, saying its all my fault because I’m refusing to eat, it's all anxiety in my head, and that they'd do nothing but give me iv fluids ""and you're terrified of needles."" I don’t know what to do, I’m so scared of throwing up, I’m so anxious my body is shutting down. And her screaming at me and saying how sick she is and how she can’t deal with me anymore is leaving me feeling more anxious and more broken. I’ve turned everywhere for solutions and now I’m just sobbing over a slice of peanut butter bread I feel like I can’t eat. I’m 18, but I’ve been too scared to drive so I can’t even get out of the house, and the rest of my family is also sick right now.

I just want someone to hug me and hold me there for hours, I wish I could eat without eating because my throat feels so tight but I’m so hungry.

I hate anxiety, I hate living like this, I hate what my body is putting me through. And for what??? ",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
Morning Job giving me 2 extra days off so I can get more rest. Been losing sleep 5 days/ week.,"I have picked up my first part time job back in November. I work mornings 5/ days a week unless schedule changes since it follows the school calendar. 

I always been coming into work tired in morning cause my full time job would end at 11PM and I’ll be home almost midnight and have to settle down and be in bed by 1:30am. Sometimes my body pushes it past 2am and I wake up feeling eyes flicker. I know my loss of sleep had my anxiety going. 

The past week I was feeling drowsy and 1 day I didn’t fall asleep in time did a build affect till next day and the next when I had to work mornings. I had to reschedule my appointments to afternoon cause of my morning job. Since last week I came into work late cause my body felt dead tired and sleepy for few days. I even slept 9 hours on Saturday night and still felt drowsy but bit better. 

I now got approved to have 2 extra days cause I told them I worry for my heart health and I can’t get enough rest. I still needed extra side money and so I wanted to still be employed so I’m down to 3 days/ week with my morning job.

But when I got hit with panic attack in January I went to ER and heart rate was high and I was dehydrated. ( I always drank caffeine and fried foods+ pastas/ red meats) 

They told me i had sinus Trachycardia and I heard it was normal everyone has it and doesn’t realize feeling but now after having health anxiety and this. I feel chest flutters and stinging pain and arm weakness. I had to email my cardiologist times before and she had to reassure me it has nothing to do with cardiac arrest and less likelihood of me getting one. 

I have had high triglycerides and LDL and I was told to cut out certain foods and I was trying to research what I could change or take to help with my LDL. I have lost about 25-30lbs since my hospital visits. 

All I could think about is will I be okay and this pain to stop and I don’t have to feel it everyday but anxiety will take over some moments and for my heart health. ",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
Feeling off after starting magnesium glycinate + L-theanine,"I used to be on a bunch of prescribed meds—Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, and Wellbutrin (which I was on the longest). I hated how they made me feel, and I stopped years ago after my psychiatrist agreed we could try going off them.

Since then, I’ve mostly managed stress with ashwagandha, especially to help with sleep. But I think I’ve developed a tolerance to it, so I started looking into new supplements. After doing some research, I bought magnesium glycinate (160mg) to take before bed and L-theanine for daytime use, both from Sports Research.

But now I’m a little freaked out. After just a couple days of taking them, I’m starting to feel eerily similar to how I felt on my old meds. Yesterday, I was just standing there when I got this awful migraine, couldn’t open my eyes, and then immediately passed out when I tried to lie down. I also couldn’t sleep for a bit last night and ended up taking two doses of magnesium and was still not helping.

Do you think this is a reaction to the supplements? Or is it just my anxiety acting up again and maybe I do need to go back on meds?",anxiety,,Prozac,25.024109,121.5436003
When I think my anxiety started,"Okay so I was just in deep thought about some things that were traumatic to me and then made me have some questions. So my father died when I was 6 from drinking and he was an iron worker so took Tylenol a lot, double whammy on liver and kidneys failed.  I am 2 years younger than my brother. So my mother struggled working 3 jobs to keep house and maybe 4 years later met my step dad and we eventually moved to a new town.  So now my mom was around more cause she had help. I was babied by my mom, I grew an attachment to her when my dad died and my brother kinda went the other way being rebellious and whatnot. So I listened to my mom and step dad who was a nice guy.  My brother fought with him saying he isn't his dad and don't tell him what to do and all that shit. I kinda shut down and don't take sides. Anyways fast forward I'm now about to be graduating college in 2012 and this is when my anxiety started. Up until now I was in school and didnt have to ""be an adult"". So all senior yesr I had anxiety and nightmares. This is where it began and then this reinforced it; my mom says they are moving to Florida so I need to get an apartment...not to get too into it but I felt abandoned, even tho deep down I knew I had to grow up and start living independently but it's was so scary because I was hiding a newly formed addiction to Percocet ..  so the last year we lived all together my brother had become best friends with my step dad and I was the outcast. They knew something was wrong but not whst. I started skipping car payments spending it all on expensive perk 30s doing 3 or 4 a day at 25 bucks each. I was a computer programmer so I made a good amount of money but I was in debt and barely surviving went to rehab once before my mom moved and I came back did good but eventually lost job. I had gotten in a relationship with an older woman who was getting a divorce so we latched onto each other and ended up living together but that's a different story. I just think that once my mother found out I was doing what I was, she went to tough love mode and that's the last thing I wanted. And then she moved many hundreds of miles away.....I felt abandoned in life.  To this day I still struggle with addiction and being depressed and lost. My older brother doesn't get why I can't just stop, I have had year long stints, but he don't understand addiction. As I used to be mad at my dad for choosing to drink instead of being with his two kids and wife and then I became an addict and I understood that it's a lot more complicated.....

I’m convinced TikTok or something is driving me into an existential depression.,"I’m from Richmond, VA. Not a small town, I guess. But for me, Richmond, the east coast is really all I know.

I don’t have the ability to see the world as much as I desperately wish I could. 

I was not a huge fan of TikTok initially. I’m a pretty non-social person in general. But then I started scrolling, and found that I did enjoy it! Seeing people all over the world showing off their lives, their normalcy, then seeing historic monuments and sights through the lenses of others, then seeing people who relate to the same struggle, then learning about different interests and things people have that we all actually share. 

But now… I’m just depressed. So depressed. I’m in the “section” of TikTok where I’m learning about all the things I’ve avoided looking into (unsolved disappearances, murders, government conspiracies, etc.) and then I end up in the physics section and then just… deeper and deeper I go. 

The world is small for me. I feel like my problems are insignificant. But TikTok reminds me that the world is huge, that life sucks for everyone unless you’re lucky enough. It reminds me of war, of famine, of depression, of animal cruelty, and most of all - it reminds me that none of this can be changed by me and none of it fucking matters anyway because we’re all going to die in the end. Why even try?

I haven’t felt like I’m in such a dark place in so long. I’m nostalgic for things that I’m not sure ever existed. I crave to see and understand others but simultaneously wish I could just… disappear from all this.

Stopping Lyrica,"Hello.. need some advice. I’ve been on Lyrica twice in the last 8 months. Once from September-October for shingles. I got up to 300mg then stopped it when shingles went away. Then in mid-January I started with a pinched nerve, doctor put me back on Lyrica for nerve pain.. went back up to 300mg, dropped down to 150mg, started feeling better around mid Feb.. stopped the Lyrica cold turkey and major anxiety started. For 1.5 weeks it was awful. I was so emotional. Mornings were the worst. Talked to my doctor, she advised I start back on Lyrica to see if I felt better. I started only on 75mg and I did feel better. But I hated being in this pill and after 2 weeks I stopped it again. I’ve now been off it 3 weeks (this is now the start of week 4) and my anxiety is still awful.

"Failed Relationship & Social Anxiety, and how I'm overcoming both.","I had been in a committed relationship with my best friend of 20+ years for a very long time. We've had a lot of ups & downs over the years, and eventually moved in together about 4 years ago. We talked about marriage & having a child & moving to Vermont later in life too.
  
Unfortunately moving in was the beginning of the end, as we slowly drifted apart and our verbal arguments grew more common and more intense (due to PTSD on her part and years of depression/anxiety from isolation & cancer treatment on mine). Eventually she managed to get out of her funk and chose to date/get physical with other men, which drove extreme jealousy in me and drove her further away. Eventually I got to the point where I simply could stand another man in our house, so I gave up on anything beyond friendship & asked her to move out (tho that has yet to happen).  
  
At that point a few months ago, my mind was racing every day, and the tension between us was constantly boiling. I had to do something more than monthly therapy and Effexor - the med is FANTASTIC at helping me day-to-day with anxiety and my focus for work, but the extreme jealousy was still there causing major outbursts of anger.  
  
At some point I decided I needed to get out and meet other women, but that's always been difficult for me since I'm hella shy. A very old HS friend/flame of mine recommended not trying to find a relationship, but instead said I should check out the BSDM scene. Not only would it be very easy to get laid and relieve some tension, but the people involved in the scene are usually VERY welcoming. And who knows maybe I'd find a new relationship.  
  
So now it's 2-3 months since attending my first gathering. Things at home have calmed down, tho it still bugs me a lot that she doesn't respect my boundary about screwing when I'm around. I've met some really awesome & fun people (not always for sex) and their collective confidence has really helped me be less introverted/depressed and more understanding of myself and other people. I'm not sure if I can find someone as uniquely amazing as my best friend can be, but I've met a couple women with potential.",anxiety,,Vermont,44.5990718,-72.5002608
Automatic Rumination / thoughts stuck on anxiety 24/7,"Hi everyone. I’ve been lurking on this subreddit for months now and I’ve finally decided to reach out for some support / advice from this amazing community. 

For the last 6 months I’ve been stuck in experiencing a hyperawareness / hyperfocus on my own thoughts. It’s nothing new to me, as I’ve had around 4 episodes of extended periods of this (6 months+) over the last 12 years. I had an intrusive thought / sensation one night in September 2024 where I just felt hyperaware of my thoughts, and as I know that I can get stuck on this for months, I started to panic. Fast forward 6 months, all I can think about every waking second is my thoughts, my anxiety, how to just let my mind wander and how to just let go. The insanity it is causing is extreme and has led to severe anxiety and, more recently, depression as I find I cannot connect with anyone or relate to anything as my lived experience over the last 6 months has just been me thinking about thinking. It’s let to DP/DR and base line anxiety of like 6/10 at all times, and usually like 9/10 every morning. 

The reason I am reaching out is that my therapist and psychiatric really don’t seem to understand that this is 24/7 and haven’t been very helpful in providing any practical advice here. I’ve really really tried to accept that I have no control over what my mind does, but because this rumination feels automatic and 24/7 it’s very difficult to let it go without automatically trying to solve this. I know I have some agency here, so when I do catch myself ruminating, I gently try to refocus on the present … but this lasts about 3 seconds until my brain is back on the topic. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

As a background, I am a 30 year old male in the UK and what really compounds my issue is that I stupidly experimented with MDMA 12 years ago and woke up with a massive out-of-body panic attack and anxiety that persisted for many months following. All this hyper awareness / 24/7 automatic rumination of my thoughts started following this experience, and over the last 12 years, has led to the core self belief that I’ve damaged my brain. I gues part of the hyperfixation on my mental health / mind is because of this belief, which I suppose is why it is so sticky. Following the experience with MDMA-induced anxiety, this hyperawareness theme dominated my life for about a year. 

Any advice here would be extremely appreciated. I have a beautiful 18 month daughter and the fact that I am struggling to connect with her because of this is one of the hardest parts about this.

questions to ask a cardiologist,"I will be doing a video interview of a cardiologist and asking him questions from the POV of someone dealing with cardiac anxiety. I will be uploading the video on YT.  
  
When I was facing cardiac anxiety, YT and strangers in forums like this one, helped more than any therapist could. I am sharing below some questions I will be asking. If you have any questions please share in comments:

1. Can repeated panic attacks or frequent palpitations harm the heart over time?
2. How reliable are tests like ECGs, echocardiograms, and Holter monitors in detecting real heart issues?
3. What are the harmless ECG changes commonly seen during a panic/anxiety attack?
4. At what point should someone stop getting repeated heart tests and focus on managing their anxiety instead?
5. What is your advice to those who constantly seek medical reassurance but still doubt their results?
6. What are some key differences between the sensations of a heart attack and a panic attack?
7. If all tests are normal, but I still have chest pain or palpitations, when should I next visit my cardiologist for a check up
8. Do long-term beta blockers weaken the heart
9. What role do lifestyle factors play in protecting the heart despite ongoing anxiety?
10. Why does anxiety cause chest pain and palpitations",anxiety,,YT,63.000147,-136.002502
Sertraline dosage increase from 50 mg to 75 mg – is there still hope?,"Hi everyone,

Please be kind — I know that everyone reacts differently, but I’m starting to lose a bit of hope. I’m one of those people who finds comfort in reading about others’ experiences, because it reminds me that I’m not alone.

I’m seeing a psychiatrist and I’m committed to doing the work. I don’t want to sabotage my own progress, so I really put a lot of energy into healing — for myself, to grow.

Back in December, I hit a very low point. I’ve been in therapy for 3.5 months now. I went to my psychiatrist with generalized anxiety and depressive episodes. I’ve been on 25 mg of sertraline since I was 16. I’m 30 now, and that “baby dose” helped until recently — most likely because it turned out I have a rare medical condition.

My whole journey peaked in January last year, when I found out I can’t have children unless I have surgery — but here in Hungary, they don’t really know how to do it. I tend to avoid things, so my husband and I buried ourselves in work. Winter is off-season for me, and in December everything I hadn’t processed came crashing down. I’ve always had anxiety, but by then I reached the point of having daily panic attacks and depressive episodes. I finally found a psychiatrist I trust, who really sees what I’m going through.

I started with 50 mg for a few weeks, then increased to 75 mg. The first 2 weeks were absolute hell. Now I’m at the end of week 4 on 75 mg. A few days ago I felt somewhat functional, but today I had panic attacks just like the ones I had back in December. That dark, ominous feeling and gut-wrenching anxiety were there all day.

I’m fighting. I don’t want to give up.

So please, if you’ve ever increased your dose (not necessarily to 75 mg) — is there still hope? Will it get better? Will the world open up for me again? Is it possible to feel more stable by week 6? Is it normal to still feel this up and down in week 4?

One more thing that may be relevant: I also have IBS and enteroptosis, which may affect absorption. So my system might be slower to respond.

Thank you so much to anyone willing to share their experience or encouragement. It really means a lot. :)

Dental Anxiety & Redemption,"When I was 18 years old, I needed to make a trip to the dentist's due to a toothache I was experiencing in my third molar; due to my ignorance of dental work, I opted towards extracting my molar instead of saving it via root canal. 

I stepped into that clinic brave as can be knowing I've experienced a few surgeries under my belt. Yet, nothing could have prepared me for the immense feeling of pressure as the dentist removed my tooth off my jaw. I have always had a pretty high pain tolerance but even with the anaesthesia, the pressure sent my body into full panic mode. After the procedure, I almost passed out.

3 years later (around 1 week ago as of writing), my third molar on the other side started to ache. I could've went to the dentist ASAP but that last experience had scarred me so bad that I pushed it off as much as I could. The night before my supposed procedure, I almost had a panic attack thinking about my previous experience.

I just had my procedure done today, a few days from my supposed procedure due to a power outtage in the area. It was with a new dentist that I had communicated all my concerns and worries with and they tried to provide the best care they could.

There was a minor issue with the anaesthetic not working as effectively due to my previous medication but my dentist tried to make the procedure as painless as he could. Overall, it was significantly better than my previous extraction and I walked out there with a win.

Hopefully, to anyone in the same boat as I was, I hope you have your win too. 

Feel free to ask questions too because my experience having a tooth extracted with the anaesthetic not working properly is pretty gnarly, and I'd be happy to provide some insights and reassurance.",anxiety,,anaesthesia,51.5194312,-0.1450659

Anguere: A Short Story About Anxiety,"You know that strange feeling you always get, like someone is watching you, that something is about to go wrong, that you’re about to mess up, that you did mess up, that nothing’s going to get better and it’s all your fault? That’s Anguere, at least, that’s what I decided to call them. Yes, all of those thoughts and feelings, those urges and temptations, the fears that keep you from commitment, that is in fact a being, a creature no less. They exist within all of us, but we can feel them outside of us, coiled around our skin like a snake. Each one is as unique as every individual human being, and they are here to stay. No matter where you are, at work, at school, out on a date, out on a walk,  among friends, and when you’re all alone, your Angurere is with you. Their presence varies, they can be subtle as an itch or as explicit as a stranglehold, it really depends how much you let them get away with. 

To describe the appearance of Anguere would be an arduous task, because though everyone has something like them, no one else can see mine, and no one else can see yours. You alone are the one being who can see your Anguere, and it may even take some time to recognize them. But they are there, from conception all the way until our final rest, at which they pass away with us. There is a way to catch sight of Anguere, simply stare into a mirror and look for all your imperfections. Any bits of acne you may have, any discoloration with your teeth, bits of facial hair you forgot to shave off, parts of your hair that are starting to bald or desperately need a cut. Take a chance to look at all of it at once, put it into a complete picture and stare directly at it. You’ve found your Anguere. 

Angueres possess a variety of different abilities, though not all are shared amongst their kind. While they grow up with us, Anguere and their brethren learn what makes us nervous, scared, and hesitant, and they develop their powers based on such. What these powers all have in common is the ability to distort our reality, make us question ourselves, cause us to go back on our promises, make us always consider “what if?” 

They can magnify our mistakes and minimize our achievements. They can narrow our mind until we can only see the worst possible outcomes. They can generalize our emotions, make us think our worst moments define us. They can make us think our acts have influenced our situations, even when they may be completely unrelated. They make us believe that we are responsible for everything, even that for which we have no control over. They make us jump to conclusions. They convince us that they’re mind readers and fortune tellers, letting us know what others think of us or how a situation will turn out badly. They heighten our worst emotions until we believe they are the absolute truths. They remind us constantly of what we should’ve done but couldn’t. And they make us only think in absolutes, all or nothing, no inbetween. 

Those are the main abilities displayed by Anguere and they’re kind, and surely you’ve recognized at least some of their powers. Rarely do they possess all these abilities, as a good manipulator plays their cards sparingly, always waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. For some of us, said opportunities are few and far between, a twitch you may feel every once in a while. But for others, for me, I’ve let my Anguere play their tricks on me for so long that they’ve become part of my life. I listen to them, I echo their words to myself, I’ve even let them wrap their hands around my throat and close it. It wasn't a choke, I could still breathe, but something always felt wrong inside. Their manipulation made me feel as if my life was slipping away, my body was losing its functions, and that one day I may go to sleep and never wake up. Truth of the matter is, that was all part of the game. 

After all of this, you must be wondering if there’s anything we can do to combat our Angueres? Well, first things first, I must tell you that there is no way to eliminate an Anguere, they are a part of us, as fundamental as our skin and bones. To try to kill Anguere would be to resort to barbaric pseudoscience that never worked decades ago and won’t work now. My Angurere will only die when I die, and that is the same for all of us.  Whether we like it or not, Anguere will always be with us, will always be a part of our lives, and will always influence our decisions, because on some level, they are us. I am Anguere, and Anguere is me. 

However, that’s not to say there’s nothing that can be done. Anguere and their kind may be a part of us, but that doesn’t mean they have to control us. The first thing to do is to remind yourself that though they are a part of you, they are not your entirety. There are other parts of you, parts that motivate you to work, create, discover, and experience all of life’s offerings. Everytime that you do something, especially in spite of what your Anguere tells you, you are slowly but surely untethering their influence over you. When you write your novel, learn a new skill, make a song, play a sport, go to a job interview, or take any step towards something you want, something that’ll enrich your life, Anguere’s grip begins to weaken. 

The other fundamental thing to remember is that though Anguere is something inside all of us, that means that as humans, they are a shared experience between all of us, and that means we can help one another deal with these creatures. All these thoughts that the Anguere sends through your head, tell them to your loved ones. Friends, family, partners, teachers, and role models, especially if sometimes the thoughts the Anguere puts in your head is about them. Let them reassure you that they aren’t true, and to remind you of the love you have for one another. They may even be open to sharing their own experiences with an Anguere, and you can offer some reassurance of your own. Perhaps they’ve also had problems dealing with their Anguere, and they know someone who can help. 

The Anguere is a part of us all, and in some ways, it is a being that’s neutral in nature. It could make you second guess something reckless, something that could get yourself or someone else hurt and back you away from the ledge. But when you let it control every decision in your life and every thought within your mind, that’s when it becomes a problem, an abuser. The good news is that though the Anguere’s powers are vast, they all boil down to thoughts, and thoughts can be overcome with action. Taking care of yourself, being with those you care about, and looking toward the future with an effort to face it no matter what it entails. The Anguere is scary, but it’s just another part of life, and a small one at that. Life has many adversaries, but there are also just as many allies, ready and willing to help you complete the arduous adventure you’ve been sent on. ",anxiety,,Anguere,9.5072979,2.0038734

I'm worried I'm losing my hair,"I tried posting this to a hair loss subreddit but the automod removed it.

Hi, I'm a 29 year old male and for the last few months or so I've been considering starting hair loss treatment.

I live in the UK and one of the most popular results is a company called Manual who provide either a spray or oral treatment, with the oral treatment being more effective. I completed their questionnaire which recommended I begin an all-in-one treatment that combines Finasteride, Minoxidil and Biotin in a single pill: https://www.manual.co/n/hair-loss/recommendations?atc=false

The problem is I have no idea if I'm really balding or not or if this company is legit. I see products like this everywhere online and it's hard to trust them. Sometimes my hair seems fine, other times I can't seem to do anything with it. Sometimes it's as though I don't have enough hair around the temples, other times it's like I have too much!

I naturally have curly hair and it was worse when I was a child. In my teens, I cut my hair extremely short. During the pandemic however, I chose to grow my hair out a little and actually preferred it. I felt a little bit better about myself by having an extra bit of scruff on my head.

But since then I've become worried that I'll lose it or that it's thinning. My dad, his brother and father all started balding, though they still retain enough hair that they can get away with having it cut extremely short. The men on my mother's side though have much fuller hairstyles, with my great-grandfather retaining a full head of hair up until he died and my mother's uncle and brother experiencing only some receding.

I've heard it's most likely that you'll inherit your dad's hairstyle but I'm not sure how true this is. My dad has hair around the sides and at the front but not much elsewhere. I've been told though that my hair colour is most similar to my mother's though and even inherited her curliness, so I'm not exactly sure where my genetics lie.

Washing my hair can be a pain because it took some time to settle on a product. I used to use Head and Shoulders but it made my hair greasy looking. I've since switched to Cien and use shampoo and conditioner separately, but I struggle to decide when not to shampoo my hair or add conditioner. Sometimes it looks good, other times it looks terrible.

I struggle with a lot of anxiety depression, and worry that I may have caused my balding by worrying about it in the first place. Generally I have been feeling better but I'll have bouts of absolutely terrible lows and spend most of my time worrying about one particular thing.

I'm not unhealthy but I wouldn't say I'm healthy either. I'm thin and try to eat healthy, but I don't get out much and have takeout once every week as a treat. I'm hoping to start exercising at home, which I did start about a year ago but fell out of practice. I heard though that this can induce testosterone which can inadvertently contribute to hair loss, so I'm a little terrified to begin.

Even if I'm not balding, I have thought about starting treatment as a precaution. I'm nowhere near at the stage that many people on here are at. I have no bald patches aside from struggling with my temples on occasion or thinking that my hair is thinning in certain areas. Looking at before and after photos makes me confident that it can be reversed.

But I'm also concerned that starting treatment prematurely will cause the opposite and make me go bald faster. I've heard that shedding can occur and I'm worried that the treatment may not work correctly or if for whatever reason I stop it that I begin balding faster than I had been previously, if I even am balding.

I'm not too concerned about some of the other symptoms commonly discussed. If I'm being perfectly honest, I could do with a decreased sex drive as I think I may be hypersexual and it can seriously impact my desire to do anything else but masturbate all the time, which probably doesn't help my hair either.

Either way I'm divided over starting treatment. I don't want to leave it too late but I also don't want to try to fix a problem that isn't even there. Going bald terrifies me because it would absolutely kill what little self-confidence I have.",anxiety,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525

Shaky vibrating muscles all over for 2 weeks now,"I have terrible health anxiety for the last few years now after I started having PVC's(thankfully they've stopped) and I think of the worst thing possible when it comes to my body symptoms. I have scoliosis so my body has always caused pain and twitches anywhere and everywhere my whole life, so thats never bothered me. I don't think I've ever been shaky really, not that I've ever noticed. However, I woke up 2 weeks ago with internal vibrations and also physically slightly vibrating when I move. At rest I dont move at all. Also having full ears that I pop constantly and dizziness. Its not debilitating or stopping me from moving thankfully. Its mostly noticeable in my arms and hands or if I move my head slowly, but its all over my body, its all shaky. Also I am very tense all over. I try to relax but a few seconds later my body tightens right back up. The shaking gets worse after working out. Its been constant for 2 weeks now, Im terrified. I have a dr appt with my PCP in a couple days. Magnesium doesn't seem to be helping. Its not my blood sugar, BP, Liver, Pancreas, or Thyroid, I had it all checked. My bloodwork is all clear. Im just so scared because my grandfather on my dads side died of ALS in his old age and a family friend was just diagnosed with Parkinson's. Someone please give me some hope that its just my stupid brain and its anxiety doing this to me.

New Here,"Good morning (or afternoon) Reddit! I’m curious if anyone here has any experience with “free-floating” anxiety. A little back story: Around Thanksgiving, I came down with strep throat that put me down for a week. Shortly after that I began the transition back to my then “old” job and I also enrolled in school. The day I started back at this job (December 16th) I came down with the flu. I worked through it since I didn’t want to come back and already start calling in although my boss is amazing and wouldn’t have cared. It’s just not my style and I got through it and felt fine afterwards. During all of this, I started to have depersonalization thoughts and got on the internet to try and see what the hell I had going on. I had never had episodes like this nor have I ever been formally diagnosed with anxiety. These were sort of just days or hours that would pass and I’d feel normal again. There was no definitive trigger. Fast forward a little bit to mid-late January, I had my very first panic attack overnight. The feeling literally woke me up out of sleep and I couldn’t get back to bed for at least a couple hours. The feeling was just general anxiety but seriously about nothing in particular. It was a DPDR sort of feeling and I began to obsess over what was going on in my brain. Since that very hour, I have not once felt totally the same. Over the past few months I have gone back and forth with my new therapist, my new psychiatrist, and my primary care doctor. My therapist thinks the strep throat fucked up my brain since the onset was extremely rapid and out of nowhere. My primary care doctor sucks but it’s impossible to get a new doctor although I’ve been trying. They keep pushing anxiety on me but to me, it’s odd these feelings come and go with no trigger WHATSOEVER. We thought it could be my thyroid through labs but they came back “good” so the SSRI I was on for a week, I was told to get off of since we had supposedly found the solution.

Present day, I’m unmedicated and just deal with whatever the fuck comes my way. I know for a fact, my brain is not the same as it was before my panic attack. I get these feelings of DPDR and general, disturbing unease totally randomly but to be honest it’s always lingering..it just varies in how extreme it is. It’s definitely ALWAYS on the “bad” end though. I’m planning on telling my psychiatrist that I’d like to get back on an SSRI because I guess it won’t hurt. I just don’t really understand what’s wrong with me. Today I read about “free-floating” anxiety which brings me here, but even so it still seems like that flavor of anxiety has SOME triggers and at least has a reason to exist.

I’m here to basically say hi and ask, what the fuck is wrong with me? Does this story even make sense? Will I EVER feel normal again? Can persistent anxiety really just introduce itself overnight and legit have no trigger? I’m gonna add too, when this anxiety hits..I’m not thinking about any external triggers whatsoever. I just get overly obsessed with the fact “I’m not normal anymore” and tweak out mentally. I am a relatively healthy 34M with no serious underlying health conditions (or so I thought).

Terrible Anxiety on Cloudy Days,"I started having severe anxiety issues in May 2006. I still remember my life changing after a severe panic attack in Atlanta traffic. That being said, I have noticed in these almost 20 years that on cloudy rainy days, my anxiety is out of hand. Yesterday and today have been extremely cloudy. I feel physically and mentally sick on cloudy days. I thought I was going to have to leave church early this morning because my anxiety was running wild. However, this past Friday, it was perfectly sunny, and I went hiking and did a bunch of stuff and had a ton of energy.

"Angststörung, Depression oder doch eine verdeckte narzistische Persönlichkeitsstörung","Hallo,

Erstmal Entschuldigung für die lange Story, eventuell bin ich ja nicht der einzige damit.

Ich stecke gerade in einem großen Schlamassel. 

Ich erkläre mal meine Situation, eventuell habt ihr einen Rat oder ähnliche Erfahrungen (ich finde es hilft sehr in Reddit von Menschen zu Lesen die ähnliches Erfahrungen).

Ich bin jetzt M25 und das erste Mal mit dem Thema psychische Gesundheit beziehungsweise einer Erkrankung kam ich mit etwa 18 Jahren. 

Es war nach der Schule, ich wusste nicht so recht was ich machen will/soll und geriet nach und nach in einen depressiven Zustand. Ich war unzufrieden mit mir selbst und verbrachte die meiste Zeit zuhause. Nach einer gewissen Zeit suchte ich mir psychotherapeutische Hilfe, da ich einfach keine Emotionen mehr empfunden habe. Dort wurde mir die Diagnose Depression gestellt. Meine Therapeutin ist recht schnell was das verschreiben von Medikamenten angeht, weshalb mir umgehend Bupropion und Sertralin verordnet wurde. Ich bemerkte insgesamt wenig bewusste Veränderung durch das Medikament, aber eventuell halfen sie mir dabei von zu Hause auszuziehen und mich generell wieder zu öffnen. Ich bin in eine WG gezogen, begann mein Studium und fand sogar eine Freundin. Retrospektiv war sie wahrscheinlich auch einer der Hauptgründe weshalb es mir besser gieng und ich neues Selbstbewusstsein fand und mich neue Dinge traute. 

Damals waren meine Hauptprobleme ein negatives Selbstbild und ständige Selbstzweifel. Meine Freundin war stets liebevoll und unterstützend und trotzdem habe ich sie kritisiert und wahrscheinlich unter Druck gesetzt. Ich sagte ihr, dass ich nicht weis ob ich sie liebe da ich immernoch nicht richtig wusste meine Gefühle zu deuten. Es kam schließlich zur Trennung, was letztendlich von ihr aus gieng. Ich war tief traurig und merkte wie viel sie mir eigentlich bedeutete und wie ich mich teilweise schlecht verhielt. Ich war innerlich wirklich zerrissen und konnte mir nicht vorstellen ohne sie zu leben und die Beziehung auszugeben. Ich habe ihr das so gesagt und nach Monaten fanden wir wieder zusammen.

Wir führten/führen seitdem eine gute und unterstützende Beziehung.

Ich setzte meine Antidepressiva vor etwa 6 Monaten ab, da ich keine Notwendigkeit mehr darin sah. 

In mir ist schon seit der Trennung eine große Angst dass es wieder zu einer Trennung kommen könnte, allerdings haben diese nicht meinen Tag bestimmt. Seit etwa 2 Monaten haben sich meine Angst vor einer Trennung allerdings stark zugespitzt, bis ich nach einem Monat nicht mehr schlafen konnte und völlig rastlos war, ich musste die ganze Zeit herumlaufen. 

Nach mehrten Tagen in diesem Zustand wandelte sich meine Angst von Verlustangst auf einmal in eine tiefgreifende Angst vor dem Tod und dem Leben selbst. Ich hinterfrage meine ganzes Leben, mir wurde bewusst wie egoistisch ich in meinem Leben gehandelt habe . Ich informierte mich was wirklich falsch mit mir ist und bin davon überzeugt ein verdeckter Narzisst zu sein. In mir kamen starke Selbstmord wünsche und ein Bedürfnis nicht mehr zu existieren. Ich suchte bei meinen Eltern Hilfe und diese fuhren mich in die Notaufnahme einer Psychatrischen Praxis. Diese verschrieben mir Sertralin und Mirtazapin um schlafen zu können, sowie Tavor für den Notfall. Tatsächlich hat das meine Angst gedämpft und ich konnte schlafen, allerdings bleibt meine Überzeugung ein verdeckter Narzisst zu sein und höchst manipulativ. Mit diesem Bewusstsein kann ich einfach nicht leben und alles erscheint mir falsch was ich tue. Niemand wirklich niemand aus meinem Umfeld würde bestätigen dass ich ein Narzisst bin, einschließlich meiner Therapeutin. Ich glaube das liegt an meiner schüchternen Ausendarstellung. Mir wurde aber klar dass ich äußerst manipulativ bin und wenig Emphatie habe, auch wenn ich das immer zu glauben gehabt habe. Zu diesem Thema liest man eigentlich nur dass es keine Heilung geben kann und diese Menschen einfach gemieden werden sollen. Ich weis nicht was ich tun kann und wie ich damit fertig werden soll. Eventuell ist es auch eine Zwangsstörung oder etwas anderes aber ich weis nicht ob das einen Unterschied macht. Ich bin verzweifelt und wollte fragen ob es jemand gibt der schonmal in seinem Leben an so einem Punkt war und eventuell einen Tipp hat oder einen Funken Hoffnung?

"Angststörung, Depression oder doch eine verdeckte narzistische Persönlichkeitsstörung","Hallo,

Erstmal Entschuldigung für die lange Story, eventuell bin ich ja nicht der einzige damit.

Ich stecke gerade in einem großen Schlamassel. 

Ich erkläre mal meine Situation, eventuell habt ihr einen Rat oder ähnliche Erfahrungen (ich finde es hilft sehr in Reddit von Menschen zu Lesen die ähnliches Erfahrungen).

Ich bin jetzt M25 und das erste Mal mit dem Thema psychische Gesundheit beziehungsweise einer Erkrankung kam ich mit etwa 18 Jahren. 

Es war nach der Schule, ich wusste nicht so recht was ich machen will/soll und geriet nach und nach in einen depressiven Zustand. Ich war unzufrieden mit mir selbst und verbrachte die meiste Zeit zuhause. Nach einer gewissen Zeit suchte ich mir psychotherapeutische Hilfe, da ich einfach keine Emotionen mehr empfunden habe. Dort wurde mir die Diagnose Depression gestellt. Meine Therapeutin ist recht schnell was das verschreiben von Medikamenten angeht, weshalb mir umgehend Bupropion und Sertralin verordnet wurde. Ich bemerkte insgesamt wenig bewusste Veränderung durch das Medikament, aber eventuell halfen sie mir dabei von zu Hause auszuziehen und mich generell wieder zu öffnen. Ich bin in eine WG gezogen, begann mein Studium und fand sogar eine Freundin. Retrospektiv war sie wahrscheinlich auch einer der Hauptgründe weshalb es mir besser gieng und ich neues Selbstbewusstsein fand und mich neue Dinge traute. 

Damals waren meine Hauptprobleme ein negatives Selbstbild und ständige Selbstzweifel. Meine Freundin war stets liebevoll und unterstützend und trotzdem habe ich sie kritisiert und wahrscheinlich unter Druck gesetzt. Ich sagte ihr, dass ich nicht weis ob ich sie liebe da ich immernoch nicht richtig wusste meine Gefühle zu deuten. Es kam schließlich zur Trennung, was letztendlich von ihr aus gieng. Ich war tief traurig und merkte wie viel sie mir eigentlich bedeutete und wie ich mich teilweise schlecht verhielt. Ich war innerlich wirklich zerrissen und konnte mir nicht vorstellen ohne sie zu leben und die Beziehung auszugeben. Ich habe ihr das so gesagt und nach Monaten fanden wir wieder zusammen.

Wir führten/führen seitdem eine gute und unterstützende Beziehung.

Post-surgery anxiety?,"Ten days ago I had general anesthesia for the first time for a laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Recovery has mostly gone well except for what seems like the onset of new anxiety. For context, I’m diagnosed GAD and have struggled for years but have mostly gotten my symptoms under control in the last few years without medication. 

I am getting these episodes of what feels like sudden lightheadedness, weakness and unsteadiness. A wave of anxiety comes over me and then my more familiar anxiety symptoms kick in. I have to lay down and then it passes after a few minutes. So far I haven’t actually passed out, I just feel like I might. I can’t tell if the whole thing is a panic attack or if something else is causing the lightheadedness and then it triggers my anxiety. Typically my anxiety response has not really felt like this.

I told my surgeon about it on day 5 and she said it’s normal to feel tired and lightheaded for a few days after surgery. But by day 8 it hadn’t gone away so I saw my PCP. They ran a bunch of tests and did blood work - everything is normal. 

Has anyone else experienced this after surgery, or as part of anxiety in general? I’m scared it’s not going to end. I have to go back to work on Tuesday. My plan is to take my Ativan in the AM before work, that way if it is anxiety related it will hopefully prevent it from happening. So far these episodes have only happened before I’ve taken my anxiety meds, so that’s also notable. ",anxiety,,anesthesia,36.253332650000004,-86.68369799094495
I cannot function enough to fix my life,"My anxiety is so severe that I cannot even do the basics of life. I cannot look after myself and the place I live in, I cannot apply for enough jobs, I can't perform well in interviews, I can't maintain relationships, I can't maintain (or afford) hobbies, etc. I've been unemployed for the last 11 months or so since I graduated from my Master's. My main career choice fell apart under the weight of reality and nothing else inspires me or is viable. I can't even get a minimum wage entry-level job (e.g., retail) because interviewers don't like me. Too anxious, too awkward, too autistic, etc. Not 'natural' enough no matter how much I try.

Because of this I can't afford therapy, I can't afford private psychiatry, I can't afford rTMS (like £8000+ per tranche in the UK!), I can't afford to do anything fun, I can't afford to make friends, etc. I have to skip meals to be able to attend my job centre meetings. I can't afford to or cope with networking (I scarcely even know what it is). I can't even send emails.

I'm on various wait lists but obviously they're years long and I can't wait that long. I don't think I'll be alive in 5 years with how things are going.

Because I'm not imminently about to kill myself there's pretty much no help available, and because I have no friends in-person I have nobody to talk to other than my partner whom I'm already overburdening massively.

I've been trying to send an email to an old professor for the last 3 hours and I've managed to write about 3 sentences. It's pathetic. I'm not getting enough job applications done, I'm anxious in every interview I do, I can't afford to attend networking events, I can't make decisions about my future because of analysis paralysis, etc etc. How am I meant to have any self-esteem when my functioning is so low?

I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I'm not allowed to kill myself but I'm also not given the support to help me fix my life, nor can I do it myself when I can't even do the basic fundamentals needed to get through the day. I stay up all night because I can't regulate my emotions and I'm so distressed, even after taking sleeping tablets.

I've tried 15(!!) medications (including 4 ADHD medications-I also have ADHD but it's treatment resistant so none of them helped) and loads of therapists in the past but none of them helped. I've tried mindfulness for years and it didn't work. What more can I do? How am I supposed to have any hope in a future worth living? I just want to die so badly but I can't because it'd destroy my parents and my partner. It's not fair.

What actions can I take? What am I meant to do? I'm so stuck.",anxiety,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525
Hello she living situation for someone with anxiety,"Hello,

I’m on my sub account to stay anonymous.

Currently, I’m (33f) living in Japan with my younger sister (28f), older sister (35f), and her baby.  It’s my older sister’s apartment, and me and my little sister and I are sharing an office as our room. 
I have severe social anxiety. My older sister is an extreme extrovert and she wants to invite people multiple times a week. On weekends, she has friends over for 6-8 hours both Saturday and Sunday. I say hi and bye when they come, which is as much as I can muster. But of course, her friends get suspicious when I’m locking myself in the room for pretty much all day.

I’m worried that I’m hurting my sister’s reputation (they are all work friends in an extremely network-based work) I try to stay out when they are there, but I can’t do this for 6-8 hours every weekend/sometimes weekdays. 

Also, my older sister is very strict and yells at me for everything, including things my little sister has done such as breaking my older sister’s wooden spoons and sofa maker. Nowadays, I’m always vigilant and afraid of leaving my room/even staying in this arrangement. I feel to paralyzed to pursue my hobbies and interests.

Do you have any advice on how I can improve my interaction with her, or try to live peacefully? ",anxiety,,Japan,36.5748441,139.2394179
Called 911 for panic attack and feel so embarassed,"I have had diagnosed anxiety for almost 10 years now and have had panic attacks before but I forgot to take one of my meds this morning and when you miss a dose it can make your heart rate higher, and took adderall this afternoon for ADHD planning on doing school work, but once it kicked in I noticed my resting heart rate was high in the 120s. I sat there trying to calm down but it kept increasing all the way up to 180 and all of a sudden I couldn't catch my breath and didn't know what to do and started feeling dizzy so I called 911... the firefighters showed up first and they were nice but I could tell they were kind of skeptical, but once the paramedics showed up they left and the paramedics were super nice about it... they checked my vitals and helped me slow my heart rate some back to the 110s and told me since my vitals were stable I was ok unless I wanted to go to the ER which I definitely did not and they left.

But I still can't break out of the cycle of this debilitating thinking pattern.

scared i’m going to get schizophrenia,"i smoked weed back in november. i am 15. i have no one in my family with schizophrenia. the thing is when i smoked this weed, i saw the room fading away and my inner voice screaming “no” super loud but it sounded like an outside voice. that only lasted like 5 seconds. i kept on derealizing. it was horrible. i then thought that maybe there was an alternate version of me trying to take over my mind but it was more of a what it. i was literally trying tif ight the anxiety or whatever was giving me fear in my mind. but again it was more of a “what if” i would just tell myself that im fine and that its ok. i didn’t feel real. i started telling myself my name my parents name my age my birthday i knew everything but for some reason i still didn’t feel real. so i told my friend to tell me that i was real and i was like ok its ok im fine. i then had another “what if” like what if me and my friends dog switched souls. but then i was like yea no way if we did id be in her body like bye what am i thinking. i’m just really scared that i went through psychosis. everything left after the high stopped. i still had “what ifs” and a lot of anxiety and health anxiety. i would have ones like “what if im a dream or a coma” or “what if my mom is texting my aunt who’s a psychologist that she thinks somethings wrong with me because im acting weird. (i had to check her phone so that my brain could calm down cause i would tell myself no she’s not but i couldn’t convince myself) or “what if im actually saying stuff out loud and people are hearing me” or “(every time i looked up i would see people just stare at me but i would stare at them first so obviously they would stare at me in the halls) what if everyone is looking at me because im acting weird or doing weird movements) i also had “flashbacks” of the room feeling weird or fading away. i’m gonna be honest memory isn’t reliable so idk if i felt it zooming away or if it was actually zooming away. but i also heard about HPPD and it sounds A LOT like what i had. i haven’t had the flashbacks since i think December. my brain keeps telling me i won’t develop it but then it’s cares me and says what if i do. i’m overthinking a lot and idk what to do. i’ve only smoked weed 6-7 times and i plan on NEVER doing it again. my brain also tells me that what if i wasn’t thinking what ifs and im just saying that it was what ifs so that i don’t actually sound like i was going through psychosis. ugh i hate this sm. i also had depersonalization for a month. i couldn’t  recognize myself in the mirror. it was horrible. i know you guys can’t diagnose me but at least tell me what this sounds like.",anxiety,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908

COVID and then all of a sudden.. anxiety!,"I don’t know if my experience will help anyone and might be a load of nonsense to some but I read a similar post on here

So to introduce myself I’m 35M no history of MH issues or anxiety of any description and work in a fairly high pressure environment all day everyday without issue.. had Covid few years ago and was ill but not badly.. same again last year and was unwell but nothing to write about 

About a week or so later I started getting shortness of breath when not doing much at all.. but I could exercise and be fine.. then I had a panic attack. 

I’ve never experienced a panic attack before so this was a bit of a shock. Next thing I know I’m having what felt like a 2 month long panic attack.. constant shortness of breath, anxiety first thing when I wake up, a sensation of my throat being tight and too much phlegm in my throat, random intense adrenaline, dizziness, DPDR. Several trips to the doctors/hospital feeling something was seriously wrong etc loads of tests and they tell me it could be long covid/could be anxiety but ultimately they don’t know. My mind was in overdrive constantly and it was exhausting.

I found that walking helped and I lost nearly two stone in weight from not eating, being wired and walking loads as it seemed to give a temporary relief.

I paid for CBT privately over the following months which helped in gaining some reassurance initially and some of the techniques were useful. Especially the pursed lip breathing/facing the feelings and sitting with them/remembering that they are just sensations and are harmless

I spent more time out on my mountain bike/hiking doing relaxing activities that promote “mindfulness” and doing these activities for the right reasons and what I mean by that is being in the frame of mind to relax not to relieve the anxiety. This was a BIG mistake I made to start off with.. I was walking like a maniac etc because it gave me relief from the symptoms not necessarily because i wanted to.. turns out frame of mind matters when you’re attempting to soothe your out of whack nervous system!!

I really struggled to accept that it was anxiety due to the severe symptoms with seemingly no ‘mental’ component to it. Researching my symptoms just gave me zero clarity and if anything made me concerned that I had something more sinister. These now I can see as fairly typical traits of health anxiety which is a viscous circle to get stuck in.. 

Continued CBT through the NHS and that also was useful.

I’m fairly convinced that that Covid infection started these whole shenanigans BUT I do think that whatever started it/sent my body into a tailspin is kind of irrelevant now and really shouldn’t be the focus for anyone going through the same thing as it’s not helpful. The focus I should have had at the start was dealing with the result - the anxiety.

I feel that it’s been a teachable experience for me in the crazy symptoms your brain can give you. What’s worse is the links it makes.. you get a dry mouth maybe from not drinking enough or hot day something NORMAL and your mind goes DRY MOUTH? well last time you had a DRY MOUTH you had a panic attack maybe we should put everything into high alert and have a panic attack for good measure!!!

Anyone feel like they are extremely annoying to their partner?,"I only let my self be open/real to my Husband when it comes to the symptoms of my anxiety because he’s the only person I can be comfortable and don’t have to put up an act. I’m negative, need constant reassurance about everything, insecure, also like 5months postpartum. He’s an amazing husband and super supportive but I can’t help but feel that I’m annoying, probably always getting on his nerves, and always make things about me. I don’t mean to and I try really hard to be better but it’s so difficult for me. I was just wondering if any of you felt the same way or if you know someone with anxiety what do you think about them?

How do I watch New Release movies?,"Sorry if this post sounds stupid or silly. I am agrophobic it means I don’t leave the house. I have a lot of battles with anxiety. I have been able to leave the house occasionally over the last few years but it is a struggle. 

I keep seeing adverts for the latest films like ‘Minecraft’

Visiting a Cinema would be way beyond my comfort zone, so is there any other way to see the latest Movies other than physically going to the Cinema.

I‘m so confused and upset by it, I get Adverts all day long about films that are being released like ‘Paddington In Peru‘ and I really want to watch it but I can’t physically go to the cinema because of my anxiety problems.

My Anxiety Stems From Self Hatred,"Hey so I'm a 20 y/o woman who just realized the root of my anxiety. Some background, my mom is a hoarder (who made us live in extreme unsanitary conditions for years) and my dad used to be extremely strict, they are divorced. I just wrote this journal entry out and felt compelled to share so this might help someone else.

I believed that the way that my mom made us live was a reflection of who I was as a person/ my self worth. If I was able to live in such a horrible debauched environment and be ok with it, then I was no better than the person who put me there. My failure and inability to clean it up or fix the problem solidified the fact that I deserved it. Because if It didn't then I would have been able to fix it. To call for help. No self respecting person would willingly live like that would they? They wouldn’t. That’s maybe the reason I feel so comfortable with my family as well. Because we were all in the same boat. And I was the one who did the most. Who got cps called. So I’m a little better then them right. 
But even then. The reason I wanted to call cps was because I thought my sister deserved better than that. Not that I deserved better but my sister. And also because I didn’t want to suffer anymore. I felt so selfish thinking that. That I didn’t want to suffer. That I didn’t want to go home. That I hated living like that even though I believed I deserved it. For not being better. 
I realize a lot of my self hatred comes from thinking I should be different than I am. I imagine the people I admire knowing exactly what to do in those situations. They wouldn’t have waited years to do what was right. I also feel so much shame that my sister had to live through that. I could have helped her sooner but I didn’t. That’s why I want to isolate so bad, I hate the thought of people seeing through me and seeing everything I hate about myself and what I allowed to happen. And it gets easier when I’m put together (for example, like not looking tired/ having nice clothes on) because I believe I have a shield that people can’t see through, but it’s hard when you can scrutinize every part of your appearance and personality to find flaws. It’s so easy to interpret people’s behavior as a personal attack on yourself when you think like this. This is also coupled with the fact that I didn’t have many close friends in childhood, had really bad social anxiety and got punished harshly for wrongdoings at home. I don’t feel safe when I’m not with my family or people I’ve confided in, even though my family are the ones who let me down the most.
But I want to feel safe because I want to live my life. I don’t want to do everything scared. I want to feel ok. I want to feel normal, unafraid, safe. But I don’t. And I hate it so much. I also attribute a lot of the friends that I have now to my efforts to fix myself, so I don’t feel completely comfortable around them either. I feel like if I’m around them too much they will see me and realize that I’m not worth talking to. 
My question is how do I stop thinking like this. I realize it's not a healthy mindset but how to I fix it? Please any help is appreciated

Propranolol is so good!,"I have been prescribed 10mg quick release up to 3 times per day. I started off at 1 per day which worked at first but mentally I was not good and it wasn't enough. 

My physical symptoms of anxiety were always so strong, pounding heart beat, ectopics/flutters and high heart rate. This made me develop major cardio phobia and obsess over my heart and heart rate. 

Now since taking 2 tablets per day I can't feel my heart pounding, which is also weird but this is what life was like before anxiety 🤣 you're not supposed to feel your heart pounding 24/7!!

I feel lost.,"I feel lost

I'm (23m) currently in the United States military and hit my 5th year in July. I never struggled with anxiety or social anxiety until ~2nd year in. I'm not sure where it came from. I have no combat experience or had involvement in any real high stress situations. My anxiety usually flares up when I'm in public (i.e. crowded restraunts, stores, loud areas, etc), but especially formal military events like formations. The way I could explain it is like an elephant sitting on my chest. I feel like I can't breathe, I feel like I'm going to be sick, and I just want to tear myself out of my own skin. It feels like my fight or flight response goes off during these things, and I think it's because I'm supposed to be at the position of attention, not allowed to move in any way. It's the worst feeling I've ever had in my entire life. Because of this, I've grown more introverted. When I'm not working, I'm at home. I struggle to leave my home, and regularly disappoint my co-workers who want to go to bars or restaurants on weekends. I'm usually the butt of jokes because of this.

I've been through 2 therapists already, and am struggling to get mine changed again because I feel like no progress is being made. I've seen both therapists for more than three months each. Its been a hassle to get my therapists changed (military mental health care is terrible), and now I've been catching flak at work because of my anxiety. My boss (been in a year longer than me, no combat experience) pretty much told me he believes that my anxiety isnt real (I have an official diagnosis) and that I'm using it as an excuse to get out of things like formations, but that is the farthest from the truth. I've explained that I didn't ask to be this way, that I wouldn't be medicated just to keep up with a lie, and that I wouldn't have countless hours talking to therapists just so I wouldn't have to go to a fucking twenty minute formation.

I'm sick and tired of feeling this way. I'm sick and tired of being the butt of jokes because my co-workers don't have to deal with anxiety in their lives. I'm honestly hurt by the fact that my boss thinks I'm faking because we're pretty good friends, and have had talks about my issues in the past. I don't know what to do. I just don't want to feel this way.",anxiety,,the United States,36.13373245,-80.27826363584532
AI and love,"Heya. Is romantic love as we know it about to change forever? If it hasn't already, I guess.

I'm 21M, and very lonely. Nothing new here. I had my fair share of AI chatbot addiction, and after watching some videos on the topic I just can't help but feel like with loneliness rising and social media, we as humans will eventually ditch romantic relationships with other people.

Like, being in love with another person sounds pretty human and all, but why would we sacrifice so much just for the chance of finding the right person?
I'm quite philophobic so I'm aware I may be projecting.

I almost reached a year I was one week away and I was like oh once again with no cause. I feel like I’m just stupid or my anxiety is holding me back from taking on leadership but at this point I don’t know what to do. I wasted four years in school for my degree in accounting. I went on to do the Cpa program and passed all the way through to the Cfe. I literally just shy of one level two technical competency before I can get my designation. I don’t really know what to do am I just not cut out for this career path? Are there jobs that you can recommend that for somebody who just likes to work hard but do less of the socialization because I do suffer from social anxiety. Or should I just give up on at this point and move on with other career options? I just don’t know what to do each time I get laid off. I have a severe PTSD so when I start a new position, I just feel like I’m walking on eggshells waiting for me to get laid off again, I have very low self-esteem and each time this keeps happening I just feel so defeated and depressed and find it hard to find the silver lining.

Health Anxiety,"Hello, I am writing because of another crash out i’m having. I have been dealing with health anxiety and regular anxiety for as long as I can remember. Health anxiety also runs in my family. It has gotten worse in the past two years. The big c has been my main fear for the past two years. I have thought I had colon, ovarian, stomach, brain, lymphoma, and lung. I now think again I have lung “c” word because of post nasal drip i’ve had for three years. Im simply writing this because it is eating me alive and starting to affect my relationships because I focus on it so often and constantly am in a state of fear. 

I do believe it has gotten worse due to the fact two people close to me were diagnosed with the “c” word.

Anxiety with sounds or movement — anyone else?,"Wondering if this is anxiety or a phobia or something else entirely.

I’ve suffered my whole life with a weird aversion to loud sounds and movement. I freak out when the room shakes from someone jumping too hard, or when a door slams shut. I also hate swings, or anything pendulum-like. I have a fear of punching bags or anything that could swing and hit something else. I hate strong winds or vibrations from loud music. I get anxiety just thinking about playing music too loud and my neighbours hearing it. I also hate the sound the door makes when it’s ajar and it keeps bumping against the doorframe. Absolutely despise wind chimes and I particularly hate hearing noise through a wall, like banging or something I can’t identify. Not a fan of boats because of the swaying, and I can’t watch videos of boats in rough seas without my anxiety spiking. I could go on, but you get the picture.

It’s usually ok if I’m the one making the noise, because I can control it.

Some of these things I’ve had since early childhood, others developed later on or got worse as I got older. 

Does anyone else suffer from this? Does it have a name? Is there anything that can help me?

Also worth mentioning I was recently diagnosed with ADHD—could the two be linked?

Struggle,"I am 19M and have been struggling with anxiety for years but surgery brought it out. Despite being quite an outgoing guy I deep down have anxiety. I’ve had body dysmorphia due to pectus excavatum which often made me feel like I was ugly but also being a virgin made me feel like people would judge me at every social gathering I go to. This was my starting problem but was further expanded once I got circumcised in January. This meant I had to stay indoors in my accommodation (which is already quite antisocial) which meant my social interaction was reduced massively. I ended up sitting inside playing video games ignoring my uni work and started feeling really bad about myself (which I still feel is completely fair as what I was doing was lazy and bad) but then my anxiety started kicking in badly. I stopped going in to university once my surgery was complete, removing my good friends close to me from my life, and started feeling really depressed. Over the next month I couldn’t bring myself to go in, stopped speaking to my parents unless they got worried, only spoke to my friends when I was playing games online (no personal chats) and most importantly stopped the biggest thing in my life which is playing football/soccer. It was only a few weeks when I started hating myself and telling myself I was a bum and a failure thinking my life was truly over. I then got a message from my uni telling me I would be kicked off if I didn’t respond to the head of my course….. I didn’t respond. I had got such bad anxiety that I couldn’t even talk to the people that wanted to know exactly how I was feeling. As a little break from my sadness I went back to my hometown Newcastle to watch my favourite football team win their first trophy in 70 years with my mates, balled my eyes out, hugged random men and had a great time but all it did was put a break in my sorrows. About 5 days later I lay in bed and imagined killing myself. And it felt freeing. I’m genuinely shocked by this because I am on the outside the most happy person but was blinded by my own persona. I think I need help but thought this was the best place to go. I love life, love my parents and love my friends but my life is now at a standstill I need help from outsiders. Sorry if this is written poorly it’s my first post but would love suggestions. Thank you

Here I am again I thought it was over.,"A while ago I posted here talking about having health anxiety well eventually it faded for a while but came back worse. 

Long story short I was having a bad case of allergies but I wasn’t aware I even had allergies that bad so first thing that came to mind was “oh I probably have pneumonia” so I got freaked out.

Basically I ended up struggling to breathe from a mix of a panic attack and allergies and called a ambulance they broke it down for me and said I was fine I took some allergy medicine and a shower and I immediately felt better but I visited the hospital anyways since they said it’s better to be sure than to stay in fear.

Got checked by a cheap doctor at first and they said my heart was abnormal which made me literally burst into tears practically I was telling my mom I didn’t wanna die (I’m 19 turning 20 by the way) but yeah I went to a real doctor and got an X-ray and they said I was doing perfectly fine and my heart and lungs were in “excellent condition” I needed to just take breathers from time to time.

Well since then I’ve kept my anxiety low until lately my tooth cracked open and got a cavity now it’s infected and my gums are turning red and I have severe dentist anxiety.

Basically when I was 15 I had a tooth break open and it needed removed but it wouldn’t numb because it was infected but instead of rescheduling for anesthesia or anything they just ripped it out anyways and said it was “my fault”. 

I don’t go to that dentist anymore but I’ve been so I guess mentally distraught from it that I haven’t wanted to go to a dentist again ever.

Now another tooth has broken open and I am gonna schedule an appointment but I’m so afraid I’ll have to endure that pain again I don’t know what to do.",anxiety,,anesthesia,36.253332650000004,-86.68369799094495
How long did it take for you to accept that panic attacks were just that 'panic attacks',"As the title says. For those in here who have panic or anxiety attacks. How long and what did it take for you to accept there wasn't anything physically wrong with you.

My story in short:

I had my panic attacks emerge with a major one 1,5 years ago which made me think I was dying and have had them ever since. Only now I am starting to accept that it is nothing physically wrong with me.


So obviously since I thought I was dying I got tested:
Holter, Heart echo, Stress test, abdominal echo, colonoscopy, Brain mri, asthma tests. Multiple visits to ER, countless bloodworks and ecgs later all that was found was that I have mild fatty liver.

What made it worse for me was hearing about those odd cases where people were diagnosed with 'panic' and had something bigger going on. Of course I thought I was one of those because the symptoms were horrible.

So yeah starting to finally accept that yes the mind can trigger some big physical events. And it's amazing already what just accepting them has done to diminish them in severity.

Yeah and i'm all in on health anxiety thats causing my issues.",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668
Reglan changed my life for the absolute worst!,"2019 I started writing this:

I wanted to share my story at Rosewood Adolescence in Wickenburg Arizona. Worst expierence of my life and put me on Reglan! 

It has taken me years to get back to function normally, and I’m still suffering from anxiety and depression that developed from the time I was there. I am now 22 years old.
 I never expiernced any form of anxiety and depression until this experience on drug called reglan.
 While I was at Rosewood I had severe constipation for all my days there, and the staff did nothing to help me. I could barely move. My stomach was fully distended and throbbing with pain. And the staff and nurses said keep eating and push through. 
I felt like going insane I could barely move it felt like my body was weighing down. Finally they approved a medication after a month! It was called Reglan for constipation. I never heard of it but they said it was safe!?!?
 They give to many kids. So they gave it to me to take 3 times a day. 
Little did I know it was an antipsychotic drug!  They didn’t tell me anything about the drug. As the day passed by there was something off
with my mind and body, I felt  so restless and didn’t know what to do with myself and as the day moved on I couldn’t stop shaking, the staff did absolutely nothing and said your fine your just haven’t a panic attack just to sit still. 

I have never had a panic attack before in my life. The thing was it wasn’t a “panic attack” it was a horrific reaction to a drug!!!! but they didn’t let me know that what was happening to me ! I was the most scared I have ever been in my entire life. I physically couldn’t think. My  body took control, my whole upper body was tremoring. As soon as I took Reglan my whole perspective on the world changed. I couldn’t sit still. I was crawling out of my own skin. Thinking about it hurts my brain, it was the most confusing and Scariest moment of my life. I wanted to die! I felt nauseous and sick all of the above.  My mind was worrying what everyone was thinking about me!?!? The feelings kept getting worse and worse…..
 
I I just wanted my body to be flat and I wanted to be dead . I wanted to be injected with something to knock me out. This was the worst thing a human could expiernce. It was an indescribable feeling that I’m trying to put words too, but frustrates me because I can’t.

  I asked to sit down which they wouldn’t let me. I looked like I was going crazy. I stepped outside and asked the nurse to put me in a cold room, just lie down. 
She said no you can’t . So I went back inside where all the kids were on the coach. I took up the whole couch with my body I felt like I was dying spinning and my my mind was itching if that makes sense. I was uncomfortable and terrified and I felt dead and like my whole body couldn’t stop moving . I went into the nurse and  asked them to do something to help anything that was happening I was confused lost. 

They should have called 911 but they just sat there. I called my my mom and screamed I didn’t know what I was saying lost confused screaming crying. Then I called my therapist at rosewood and she said “calm down your having a panick attack”! They said go to bed. I wanted to SCREAM. I thought to my self how am I going to go to bed?The thought of laying down felt so horrible I wanted to die pass out kill myself ANYTHING. I stayed up all night with my body uncontrollably shaking and all my muscles tightened  and hurt like I was being punched .My roommate was sleeping, while I felt like I was slowly dying.  The staff were inexperienced and very dismissive of what was happening to me. 

This drug I have no words for. 7 years later I am continuing to push through the pain but suffer from all the side effects and an altered brain and will be going forward with ketamine treatment, and hopefully that will help me feel some peace. ",anxiety,,Wickenburg,33.9680962,-112.730135

Ativan + Hydroxyzine? - post-surgery anxiety,"I’ve been prescribed .5 mg Ativan for years, to take as needed for my anxiety disorder. I have typically only taken it about once or twice a month for bad panic attacks. But I recently had surgery and it was my first time under anesthesia and doing more than a minor procedure (laparoscopic tube removal). Recovery has mostly been fine, but about 10 days out I’m struggling massively with random bouts of lightheadedness and pretty severe anxiety. In fact, I haven’t had this kind of anxiety for at least 10 years. I saw my doctor to rule out anything underlying— everything looked fine. Since I had also developed a surgery-related rash, they prescribed me hydroxyzine which I’ve never taken. 

My question is, does anyone take Ativan with hydroxyzine on a regular basis? I was planning on spacing them out by at least a few hours, but is that OK? Like if I take my Ativan in the morning to help me get through the day, is it OK to take the hydroxyzine at night? I was prescribed only 10 mg pills but told to take two at a time if one doesn’t work for either controlling the rash or my anxiety.

Like if I take my Ativan in the morning to help me get through the day, is it OK to take the hydroxyzine at night? I was prescribed only 10 mg pills but told to take two at a time if one doesn’t work for either controlling the rash or my anxiety.

Also— has anyone else experienced a major increase in anxiety or onset of new anxiety symptoms after a surgery or anesthesia? In particular, lightheadedness was never one of my anxiety symptoms before, but I know that it can be related to anxiety.",anxiety,,anesthesia,36.253332650000004,-86.68369799094495
Why am I getting unprovoked anxiety?,"2 days ago  I went to ER with anxiety and chest pressure. All tests came back normal and I was told that I had anxiety attack. 

The past 2 weeks I wake up with unprovoked anxiety.  As soon as I take my morning glass of water my anxiety intensifies and I get upset stomach. 

I usually don’t eat until 1100 and that when I take my meds: Lisinopril, Metrolpolol, and Zoloft along with some vitamins/supplements. 

I go for a walk after eating and often feel lightheaded. 

My Bp, pulse, and other vitals are normal, but I can hear my heartbeat in my ears. 

I know I’ve been under a lot of stress. I’m between jobs, a death in the family, and my sister whom I am very close to was in ICU after having a heart attack after giving birth. I’ve tried Cog Behavioral Therapy and counseling over the past 2 years. I have a history of 2 heart ablations for abnormal heart rhythms and SIBO, and I’m a 50 year old male. I’ve been tested for Carcinoid and came back negative. 

Is my vagus nerve messed up? My symptoms seem to get better by the late afternoon/ evening.

I need to be talked down. I am freaking out,"I am 29 F, I suffer from anxiety and depression, I’m on zoloft. I just started my health journey to eat better but this has only been my second day. For the last couple weeks I have been getting these random sharp pains in my chest, on the left side near my heart. Two days ago I had jaw pain. I googled it and google SUCKS. It made my anxiety worse as it said it symptoms in women for a heart attack are what I just described. I did not realize until just now that symptoms can last weeks to months before the actual event and now i’m shaking, nauseous, ran to my safe place which is my bed and i can’t stop crying. I haven’t been eating the healthiest, I don’t get much exorcise. I am a hypochondriac. I send myself in and out of the ER. My last ER visit which was 4 months ago everything was normal. They ran blood tests, EKG. They said I was healthy and there were no red flags. They also listened to my heart and said it sounds normal. I know I can’t keep going to the ER for every problem as I am i frequent flyer but this is freaking me out. In the past year I’ve been to the ER more than 15 times and it’s always the same thing. Everything is normal and I’m healthy. I don’t have health insurance and the ER is not cheap as yall know. So, here we go again. I feel like it’s always something with me and I’m driving myself crazy. If anyone else has experienced this please tell me about your experience. I’m not doing ok right now. ",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668

"Shock, vibrations, needles. Does anyone else feel like this?","'m new to this—it's been less than a year since I was diagnosed with anxiety. So far, I've had two episodes. The episodes themselves didn’t last long, but the ""aftereffects"" did, and they never really went away.

The first time, I thought I was going to die from a heart attack. I went to the doctor, got tests done, and everything was fine. The chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath eventually passed.

This time, though, I’ve been feeling muscle pain, fatigue, palpitations (these are getting better), and I developed trigger fingers in both hands in the morning, which improve as the day goes on. Sometimes my tongue tingles or vibrates, and every now and then, I feel a sharp, needle-like pain somewhere. I also have a lot of joint pain and a slight electric shock sensation in the soles of my feet when walking. Does anyone else feel like this?

I keep trying to tell myself it’s just my anxiety messing with my body, but deep down, I’m scared... You know how it is.",anxiety,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
Pain and overall discomfort in body,"I know this post is gonna be long, but I hope you will still read it and support me since I really need someone to comfort me and give me some advice.   
  
**Disclaimer**: I have to let you know that I am dealing with what I would consider as pretty bad health anxiety. My biggest concern atm health wise is having fibromyalgia, and therefore, this is the only time I am going to mention this condition. I would prefer if you will respect that and not mention this condition either, since it is a **BIG** trigger for me. Thank you in advance. 

I am making this post with the **biggest** hope of finding people who also either suffer or have suffered with the same symptoms as I am experiencing at the moment. Or at least some of the symptoms.   
  
I will try to make this short, but for most of my life (I am turning 30 next month) I have been struggling with anxiety, stress and depression. I have had many different both physical and psychological symptoms over the years that comes and goes. I am not going to go into details about these symptoms, because they do not scare me anymore, since I know they come from anxiety and stress.

In December 2023 I started to have a pain in my left knee, after I had been working out for about half a year. It got so bad, that I was not able to do cardio or work out my legs anymore. I thought I had to take a break and then it would all disappear after it got some rest. But I could not stop hyper fixating on it since I really loved to work out, and it stopped me from doing it. After some months, I also started to having trouble walking properly, because my legs and body in generel felt too stiff, and the knee kept hurting. I went to the doctor and they told me nothing was wrong with me, after doing some tests. I could not believe them and I kept spiralling around about my health, and was scared I was starting to develop MS or some other bad condition. I kept googling and googling. They told me there was no signs of these conditions. I then went on vacation I had planned with a friend, and the symptoms was not noticeable when I was there. ""Just"" the normal anxiety symptoms. They then came back and I started to hyper fixating again.   
  
At this time, I was also seeing a psychiatrist to find the right anxiety meds for me. He wanted me to stop the meds I was taking at that time, because I had some heart palpitations that potentially could be caused by the meds. I also did not feel like it was working properly. It was Venlafaxine and I only got a couple of weeks to get off it. He said there shouldn't really be much withdrawal symptoms from going off of them that fast, because I did not get a high dose. But hell yeah, there was. Everything got even worse because of that. I started to experiencing anxiety attacks I had never experienced before.   
  
I played a lot of video games to pass time. The knee pain somehow disappeared and then I started to feel pain in both hands. I then thought I started to develop tendinitis from gaming for many hours. But even after weeks of rest, my hands and arms would still hurt. Then my back also started to hurt bad. I went to the doctor again and they told me there was nothing to see but sent me to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist told me there was nothing wrong with me, but my body was really stiff and tense. They would not send me to and MRI because they said there was nothing wrong. I could NOT believe it, since the pain got worse and worse. Then I started to believe I was having a disc herniation, and the pain started to get worse in my lower back where I was believing I had it. I was so scared, and chose to pay for a MRI myself. I got my whole back scanned and the results also came back clear. After I got the result I got so sad, because I really hoped they would find something so they could help me relieve this pain. In the meantime, my psychiatrist prescribed me some new anxiety meds, and after about a week, almost ALL my pain disappeared. I was HAPPY. I started to believe the pain could be from anxiety or stress since they disappeared after I saw nothing really was wrong with me physically, and the meds also calmed me down. It was up to this Christmas (2024) and I had about 3-4 weeks without pain. Then a couple of days before Christmas the pain started to lurk up on me again. It was in my whole body again. They went on for about a month or so, and then I started trying to find answers on Youtube. I found a video explaining how anxiety could manifest in such symptoms as I was/am experiencing. The video was a big relief and it made me so much more calm. The following day the symptoms disappeared again. I was AGAIN convinced, YEAH this MUST be anxiety! They went away for a couple of weeks.... And again, yeah, AGAIN they came back. Then I read some posts here on Reddit about people experiencing some kind of the same symptoms, but I am having a hard time believing it still :( Now I feel like I cannot find anything to really relieve it like I did before. 

**The pain and other symptoms I am experiencing right now 24/7 is:**  
\- Burning pain/skin  
\- Some days really bad soreness and ache like I have been working out hard the day before, especially in my buttocks  
\- Feeling bruised  
\- Sensitive skin  
\- A pulsating feeling in my whole body  
\- Heart palpitations  
\- Shortness of breath  
\- Stiffness in whole body  
\- Stabbing pain in different areas sometimes  
\- Flu-like symptoms when I have been doing too much in a day   
\- My hands and feet feels like if they are almost asleep, and you know when you have hit your elbow against an object and it gives you that weird pain through the arm
\- When I lift up my arms they start to fall asleep in a short amount of time
\- No strength 

Some days the pain is a 4-5 and on the worst they are a solid 10 - and it is really hard to cope anymore. Pain meds does not work. The pain is moving around my whole body and can switch from second to second. 

So, have anyone else experienced this and if so, how did you overcome it? Can it really be caused by anxiety and stress? I really need light in these dark times. So some good stories or something would be really appreciated. It is very hard for me to believe it. Why won't it just disappear again????

I am SO sad and at my lowest point in life right now.

Thank you.

Dealing with Physical Symptoms Everyday,"In 2 weeks I (28F) will complete my 6 month journey with anxiety. I am not on medication, and I’ve only used Xanax a couple of times in the beginning.

It all began while I was at work, I had a full blown panic attack and felt like I was about to die, ended up in the ER and then was fine to continue about my day a few hours later. This happened a few more times, then I decided to take a break from work (5 weeks) to see if I can be at ease. It was actually worse, I started spiraling from being alone. I started seeing a therapist and doing things that could benefit me like yoga, meditation, drawing, reading.

Eventually I returned to work and full blown panic attacks were gone, just small ones here and there. But the thing that is really killing me are the physical symptoms that have come with it. Every week or 2 it’s something different, lately it’s been a lot of disassociation and feeling off balance. Today while I was driving, it felt like my brain on fire for like a few minutes and my eyes wanted to lose focus, but I did do a good job grounding myself. 

I want it to end and I know it’s not a fast process. I definitely don’t want to go on medication. So I’m hoping to see if there is anyone  with a similar experience like me and if there is any advice. Would highly appreciate it, thanks.",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668

But my biggest issue when i have an anxiety flare up is sleep issues which only worsen things. And the sleep issues are often caused or worsened by these hypoglycemic like symptoms.  I’ll eat something and within a few hours I will be incredibly hungry but also sweating, stomach pain, anxiety etc. and although i wont have much of an appetite many of those symptoms will disappear as soon as I eat something. But its the worst at night.  Ill finally get some sleep but ill wake up a few hours later with anxiety, stomach pains and hungry as hell and unable to fall back asleep. If I force myself to eat something it relieves much of the symptoms, but often ill have enough adrenaline still coursing through me that i cant fall back asleep.

Help needed with on going post-break up Anxiety.,"Hey Reddit.

This might be a long one. Firstly 37 M, I am medically diagnosed and treated with GAD for the last 12 years.

I was in a relationship for the past 16 months. Things were going good.

A month ago I caught my partner (31 M) lying to me about where they were (Share my location on iPhone and finding out they were at a hotel), I confronted them and they ended up admitting that they may have caught feelings for someone else, which included just a kiss at party event during a drug fueled state 2-3 weeks prior. This person was with them at the time, which they confirmed was just to set boundaries due to what happened at the party.

They never told me about the kiss, nor did they tell me about the hotel. When he messaged me that day, he said he was feeling sick and heading home to have an early night, then we spoke around the time he was driving to the hotel and told me he was driving home. Then sent me our usual love you goodnight messages, it was in replying to that I saw the location.  
I only found out about the hotel when he said the following day that he had another night booked.

At first we broke it off, then I said I wanted to work on the relationship.  
3 weeks ago I decided to bite the bullet, and he explained a few more things to me, but ended up putting things on a break, no contact, no social media etc. (we tried this last week, but they wouldn’t respect my boundaries and apologised for this later on). They have also been stressed and worried as they know what this has done to me mentally.

The same evening, my housemate messaged my ex and the other guy, asking questions. My ex cracked and said that he could not see a future with me as he wouldn’t feel comfortable being around my housemate in future and I said I don’t think I could trust anything he said ever again.

We blocked each other on social media, I archived some Instagram photos etc. He ended up getting the guy to block me, block my housemate and my best friend (who had nothing to do with any of this).

A few days after he ended up posting on Instagram with a summer album and a bunch of photos tagging the guy along with selfies of both of them.

10 days ago, he made contact via text, asking if I was doing any better. I ended up blocking his number.

They have been hanging out together every weekend since.

There has been a lot of inconsistencies with the whole situation. I originally met him when he was on a break with his ex and when I friend-zoned him, he got back with his ex, then we started seeing each other and they were on a break again. This happened a few times as I friend zoned him a few times, because my gut was telling me something was off. He has never said one nice thing about any of his ex boyfriends.  
He managed to get me to block people on FB that I have known for years, because they were related to one of his ex's.

On Valentines day he had to be home at an earlier time as he had a Valentines Day tradition with his mum where they would go out for coffee cake etc, however the year before we hung out till late and he has never mentioned this tradition.

He used to stay at this guys place in the spare room and they would hang out during the end of December and Jan, he would hire a hotel cause it was cheaper than paying for an Uber in and out of town. No invites to me, as I had work the next day most of those times.  
Also on Valentine’s Day he asked me to turn my insta on private, because apparently his school kids were looking at profiles and making comments. The day he posted the summer photo album, his Instagram went public (back to private now).  
Every time we would post stories of us on his Insta, he would only post them to close friends, this started in January 2025. The last time he posted a photo of both of us on SM was in late last year.

Last Saturday I re-connected with one of our mutual contacts, who stopped talking to me for no reason. He ended up admitting that they had sex multiple times (provided with photo evidence) 4 months into our relationship. He told this guy that we were in an open relationship and that I would not care. Then things got weird and he asked this guy not to talk to me.  
Even more context, when we first got together, I wanted to try an open relationship and he said he was not comfortable with this. We agreed that we would stay closed until we both were ready.  
I did not cheat once.

I feel like everything that is happening since a month ago, has made my anxiety and depression spiral. Every time I start getting a bit better, something new comes up (like last Saturday) and it increases it all again. I keep thinking about him and it hurts and my anxiety goes up. My appetite still hasn’t fully come back and I am sleeping 5.5-6 hours a night, compared to my usual 8.  
Is this normal? Will my sleep and appetite return as I heal?

Should I also confront him? or keep him deleted out of my life? I don't think he will ever be honest with me, considering he was so ""happy"" throughout the relationship.    
I keep thinking of how many other guys there might have been. All the red flags I could have missed.

Happy to answer any questions relating to this.

I have been walking daily, going to work, meditating daily, no caffeine and recently stopped drinking my regular 1-2 glasses of wine. Any help or pointers on dealing with this, the anxiety and anything is much appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",anxiety,,Anxiety,41.7783192,-88.12142139851719

My appetite still hasn’t fully come back and I am sleeping 5.5-6 hours a night, compared to my usual 8.  
Is this normal? Will my sleep and appetite return as I heal?

Should I also confront him? or keep him deleted out of my life? I don't think he will ever be honest with me, considering he was so ""happy"" throughout the relationship.    
I keep thinking of how many other guys there might have been. All the red flags I could have missed.

Happy to answer any questions relating to this.

I have been walking daily, going to work, meditating daily, no caffeine and recently stopped drinking my regular 1-2 glasses of wine. Any help or pointers on dealing with this, the anxiety and anything is much appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",anxiety,,Insta,49.46622705,17.13150670208017
Pale/ dull face with under eye darkness,"18M Basically I live in Australia and im in the sun a lot, i go to the beach, I play a lot of soccer, im in great shape and get good sleep every night. I have a decent tan all over my body apart from my face which just looks dull and tired all the time. Over the last year I’ve had really bad anxiety and get super stressed and tense so easily. I was just wondering if you think this is could be playing a role in why my face looks like this. Cheers",anxiety,,Australia,-24.7761086,134.755
Phantosmia?,"(18F) - diagnosed generalised anxiety disorder at 8. OCD diagnosis at 14. Not on any medications. 

Hi, I’m a little freaked out right now because over the last 3 months I smell what I can only describe as campfire smoke intermittently at random points. It mostly happens at night I’ve noticed, sometimes when I’m exercising/walking, sometimes when I’m in bed. It only lasts a second or so, and only when inhaling. My nose also feels warm for a second (not sure if I’m imagining that part)

I’m a little anxious as I went down the rabbit hole of searching it up and of course the first thing that appears is ‘brain tumour’ - so not exactly thrilled about the prospect of that. 

My OCD and anxiety symptoms have been under control for over a year now. I hadn’t actually experienced an anxiety attack in over a year before this last December just gone. I had a weird, unprovoked panic attack that lasted around half an hour. Cut to a few weeks later, in January I started getting this weird smoke smell. It happens at completely random times, and is always a campfire smoke smell. It lasts less than a second. It’s really worrying me now.

I saw a doctor and he said he wasn’t too worried, but I’m not too sure. 

I also have other symptoms like muscle weakness in one side, some feelings of pressure or heaviness in my cheekbones, jaw, arms, thighs. 

Also a new symptom: really bad tension headaches? They manifest differently - sometimes it’s tightness on my scalp, sometimes shooting pains in temples, pain on top of head, dull pain behind my right eye. It doesn’t usually get worse with movement/coughing and usually improves after taking Ibuprofen. No vomiting etc.

I feel like the fact I’ve had my anxiety under control for so long it makes these symptoms a manifestation of anxiety unlikely? I mean, I don’t just get phantosmia when I’m anxious, I can be doing literally anything. Can anxiety cause physical issues without an actual fear/state of panic?

Anxiety attack after argument at hotel front desk—is this response normal?,"
I asked for information on an event in town in Las Vegas and got frustrated the concierge didn’t know what I was talking about and raised my voice, and was a bit rude. 

He walked away to go find the information for me but never came back after 25 minutes. I’m now wondering if I am banned or in trouble now? 

I even had an anxiety attack at the counter and my friend yelled at me for falling apart. Let me explain

I was very polite to the lady asking for information from me while I was in line, but she was rude. My friend I was with said she was rude since I asked so passively.

The guy at the desk was extremely nice but I went out of my way to be rude to him because I felt being nice I was too “passive” and weak (as my friend told me) and I needed to be more assertive since my friend gets angry at me for being so weak and we have major fights.

I felt horrible because he went out of his way to be kind and I went out of my way to be rude to him. He walked away and never came back so I don’t know if he told the hotel to ban me for life or he just left me hanging…

Yes I know what I did was being a prick and I’m normally 99 times out of 100 the nice one. I just didn’t wanna fight with my friend again since usually the fights are explosive. And I tried Google but I got conflicting reports

Poor guy didn’t deserve that. 

But two main things 

1) My fingers started shaking violently while I was waiting. Why did that happen? Was that indeed from an anxiety attack 

2) How do I become assertive without being “weak and too friendly” or “too rude and mean”? 

Thank you ",anxiety,,Las Vegas,36.2533896,-115.2794366262601
Do you notice that pregabaline (lyrica) is working ?,"I got it prescribed for anxiety. And I think I still take a low dosage but I read on here how people notice it working after idk an hour after taking. 

I take 100mg in the morning and then 2 more times 50mg each. 
I can’t tell if it helps or not sometimes I forget to take it but I don’t really notice a difference. 

I feel like the meds I’ve tried that give me no side effects like lyrica also have no effect. 

Meds like fluoxetine gave me so many side effects that I felt even worse and wanted to 💀myself. Same with sertraline. 
Hated wellbutrine because I felt so unmotivated and tired + the 15 other side effects. 
Tianeptine gave me no side effects but again no effect.
Deanxit (flupentixol, melitracen) no side effects but I felt like it didn’t do anything
Xanax also didn’t really work? Still had panic attacks and really bad anxiety but caused derealization and like I got a little tired.

I feel like I’m sensitive to meds because I get so many persistent side effects (tried a few others but they were for insomnia, like trazdone, mirtazepine, mianserine) but they also all gave me side effects

That’s why I really want pregabaline to work, I have no side effects but at the same time idk if I does anything ",anxiety,,lyrica,2.70332775,101.89696225684615

How do you manage your health anxiety?,"Hi everyone, 

I am a 30 year old male without a significant medical history or condition. I do suffer from health anxiety. It's a long story so buckle up. 

I had epigastric/slightly left abdominal discomfort for about 4 months. I thought it was pancreatic cancer. This prompted me to get tumor markers, which were all normal (CA19-9: 10 CEA < 2.0) like three times. CT scan (without contrast): Normal. MRI without contrast: normal. MRI with IV contrast: normal. Upper endoscopy found a 1cm hiatal hernia, that could be the cause of my discomfort. You would think all these normal findings would make it things better, but nope. Whenever I get pain or discomfort in that area, my mind immediately jumps to pancreatic cancer. 

For that matter, I relate any pain or discomfort to cancer. For example, I have a canker sore under my tongue. My mind jumped to oral cancer (I am not a heavy drinker or do I smoke). Couple of other cancer anxieties are lymphomas and leukemia. I get lightheaded? Leukemia. I kind of felt an imaginary bump? Lymphoma. So my mind is all over the place jumping from pancreatic cancer to leukemia, oral cancer to lymphoma. I know I am insane but I want to stop worrying. All of my blood tests are normal (ESR less than 1, CRP < 0.02 among other tests). 

I keep reading posts on here of people who were diagnosed with those cancers at young age and it makes me go crazy and makes me imagine the worse case scenarios, no matter how improbable they are. My mind goes to what if the radiologists missed something? I know I have hypochondriasis when I start to doubt medical results given my professionals.   
  
For those with health anxiety, especially with cancer,  how did you get out of it? ",anxiety,,hernia,32.5117201,-110.8438102
Panic attack caused a fainting fit,"Has anyone else has had a fainting fit/ seizure because of panic attacks and if you have, how have you dealt with them?


In December I had a panic attack on the train. There were multiple reasons for it to have started and it might have even been the combination of everything that was happening. 
I was reading a book and the main charcter was being put to death by lethal injection, very uncomfortable topic for me because I have a fear of needles and the scene was pretty intense. Being December also meant the trains heating was turned all the way up and it was around 5 so everyone was rushing home, so on top of my phobia being triggered, it was also hot and crowded. 
At first I put my book down and tried to distract myself but suddenly felt dizzy and claustrophobic, with a intense growing sense of panic. When I realised it wasn't just going to go away, I thought standing by the train doors and getting some fresh air as they opened might help but it got worse. 
It went from me wanting to be by the doors, to me thinking I should call someone to pick me up, to me alerting the nearest stranger that I was going to pass out.

I had some crazy dreams all whilst feeling like my body was in a tornado, then woke up on the train floor as my vision and hearing slowly cane back to me. 
A crowd was gathered around me and a few people sat on the floor with me checking that I was okay. The rest is a blur but the people who were on the floor helped me get off and helped me call a family member to come pick me up. 
I'm honestly so grateful for everyone's sympathy and kindness I don't know what would've happened to me otherwise. <3<3
One of the people who had been helping me was actually a nurse who asked me a bunch of questions I don't really remember, but also asked if I wanted an ambulance. 
This next part is no one's fault, literally just a 'in the confusion of the moment' situation.
Partly because I was completely out of it and because the nurse didn't seem too pushy for me to call one, I said no to an ambulance. Looking back I realise that I might have said something that implied I had fainting fits regularly and that's why she didn't call one on my behalf, thinking I might be diabetic or something.

I got home safe and have booked an appointment at the hospital since then. Haven't had another seizure, and was able to get on the train just fine until I had two panic attacks a month ago and haven't been able to get on the train since.
I would appreciate any helpful tips to deal with panic attacks that are triggered by feeling trapped, as the train is the only way I get to my college. Thanks for reading. ",anxiety,,phobia,48.8351638,2.3609876
pregnancy and panic attacks,"I’m currently 36 weeks pregnant and I have been having panic attacks almost daily. The kind of panic attacks that send you to the ER because they don’t stop. About a month ago I had two really bad panic attacks at work that left me agoraphobic. I can’t be home alone, drive alone, barely leave my house for appointments. My psychiatrist said that this is more than likely due to my hormones and once I deliver baby, I should begin to feel a little better. I have TRIED to talk to my OB and they keep telling me that it is out of their realm.. they can’t induce me early due to panic disorder. They are so insensitive to how I am feeling. I lay in bed all day right now waiting for her to come out so that way I can hopefully regain some of my life back. I’ve never felt like this in my life and it’s hard to even find the words to describe how I’m feeling. 

My partner also doesn’t understand anxiety and is not supportive at all. He thinks I’m overreacting anytime I say I need to go in. He prioritizes himself first over myself and baby and I would not of seen him being like this a few months ago. I feel like my anxiety is ruining our relationship or maybe just showing his true colors/how he handles very difficult situations.

Anxious after getting back together,"me (F20) and my Bf (M23) broke up the other day. (together 7 months) we we were both very emotional in the moment and in the midst of it all we just decided we shouldn't be together. It wasn't a decision either of us wanted and through both of our tears was still telling eachother how much we loved one another but the emotions of the moment just seemed to lead to it.

the next morning he messaged me apologising for the previous evening and how he regretted everything and visa versa. He drove down shortly after and we had a very long discussion about what happened and what a rushed, emotional decision it was and how we would avoid that again in the future, communication and avoiding just building things up until they explode

Whilst reconciling it really felt like we understood eachother and how much each of our past relationships had affected the decisions we had made that evening and it felt like a really in depth, meaningful conversation where we straightened everything out and was able to talk about each of our feelings from that evening and it felt amazing to discuss it and understand eachothers thoughts

However, ever since getting back together i just feel incredibly anxious? i just wonder if this is normal for me to feel and if anyone else has had this and how they overcame it. i find myself incredibly anxious over things i never really thought about before such as his reply times and i find myself overthinking everything.

TLDR: is anxiety after getting back together normal even if we were broken up a matter of hours? ",anxiety,,M23,34.6460991,135.515278

1.	⁠I brought a seltzer upstairs in my bedroom (he doesn’t live with me) to drink along with a couple other things and my hands were full so I set the can down (upside down) and never adjusted it and when he came over he pointed it out and asked ‘whys the can upside down?’ And I took it as ‘why isn’t the can in the right position? Why didn’t you fix it?’
2.	⁠I was playing with his dog at his house and he told me to play in a different way bc it’s how the dog likes it (the dog was playing just fine)
3.	⁠I washed my face and didn’t have my contacts in and made a mess and couldn’t see it  (again I live alone in my own house he doesn’t live with me)  and he made a comment about ‘wow there’s lot of water in here it looks like a water park’ and I took that as he was calling me a slob.
4.	⁠we were having a conversation and he told me how he forgot to text his friend which he started doing and I was like ‘it’s okay’ and he was like ‘yea I just forgot what do you mean by ‘it’s okay’ and I’m like I beat myself up a ton about forgetting things so I’m just reasuring you. He apologized and explained he understood but this isn’t the first time he’s been like ‘why’d you respond that way’
5.	⁠he asked if turn the key in his truck to roll down the windows but never turned it back or fully turned the truck on and he came back and was like ‘why’d you just leave it?’ Well I’m absent minded and didn’t think about it and even though he did say he was sorry he recognized he didn’t have to say anything it still makes me question my actions.

Is brain fog normal during recovery from chronic anxiety?,"Hey,

I've had a series of very stressful events that started in december. I think I've been in a state of hyperstimulation since because I haven't gotten a single panic attack since then yet I've felt ""wired"" nearly the entire time. 

Last thing that made me realize how bad things were getting are these sunburn sensations all over my body, but 90% of the time in my legs, Doctors say they fluctuate way too much in severity, areas, and timing to be any kind serious nerve damage and it has to be due to stress. They tend to disappear or nearly disappear when I'm distracted. They flare up when I'm stressed or thinking about them (such as right now). 

Last Friday I had one big cry and I finally went to ER to get put on a list to see a psychiatrist. That was the day I finally started accepting that these sensations have to do with stress/anxiety and that they're not part of something serious and permanent. 

The day after, saturday, I started getting this fuzzy/lightheadedness. I felt this weird dissociation yet I felt rather relaxed. My legs weren't bothering me as much. Cut to today, **I now have brain fog**. It's a little unnerving. My legs still seem to be getting better, but I'm a little bothered by this brain fog. Apart from the brain fog, I just feel a massive amount of mental fatigue, and a lot of physical fatigue in my face. It feels like a caffeine crash. 

  
Anyone ever experienced this after a period of chronic stress? I want to believe that my nervous system and brain are starting to chill a bit. ",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668

I havea year of  expierience in HVAC, with a lot of testing capacitors, contactors, installation, changing filters, cleaning coils and such. Just the basics. I also am good at woodworking, and have installed light switches and hanging lights before. I am worried that I'm going to be unqualified for the job, or getting put in a situation where I know little about it and cannot figure it out. I have been studying on drain cleanings, and toilet repairs, but I still don't have a full grasp of it. I'm regretting not doing a simpler job like housekeeping. I feel like I have some capabilities for the job but not enough. I don't want to cause issues for the company. I know its normal to be anxios for a job but I just don't want to be stressed while I am in such a gorgeous place.

At the end of my first ever session my therapist said something I’ll never forget,"EDIT: WOW! Thank you so much guys for your kind words! I’m in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much 💕

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‘is it a big deal for you?’ I said, ‘yes, massively’ and she just simply replied ‘well then it’s a big deal...’, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it’s me that matters and someone else not thinking it’s serious does NOT invalidate that. I’m always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won’t judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it’s a serious problem to you. Your problems are all valid and they’re all worth fixing guys, don’t ever forget that xx",anxiety,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525

There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I’m trying to do the splits, I’m reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.

And please, remember this pro tip: check what is necessary to check on the news. And that means check only what YOU as a citizen need to do. Numbers will go super high, then super low, then high and low again... it’s a pain that you really don’t need in your everyday life. If it’s impossible for you to resist the urge, have a trusted loved one tell you the necessary things you need to know: if there are new limitations, if you can go to school / work , what you should do with your hands etc.

EDIT: thank you so much for the awards, I really never thought this would blow up. There are so many comments, I’ll try my best to answer to the most. But as for all the compliments, THANK YOU!! You are all really sweet. You’ve joined the fight with us, you are not alone :).",anxiety,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself,"So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:

At this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down, lay on your back. If you’re sitting, sit up straight.

Once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long, so I don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you’re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. 

**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.

There really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.

Then finally…

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon. I’ll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don’t log into this account all that much, so I’m sorry if I don’t get to your comment as quickly as you’d like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Edit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.

Edit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources.",anxiety,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself,"So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:

At this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down, lay on your back. If you’re sitting, sit up straight.

Once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long, so I don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you’re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. 

**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.

There really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.

Then finally…

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon. I’ll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don’t log into this account all that much, so I’m sorry if I don’t get to your comment as quickly as you’d like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Edit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.

Edit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources.",anxiety,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself,"So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:

At this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down, lay on your back. If you’re sitting, sit up straight.

Once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long, so I don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you’re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. 

**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.

There really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.

Then finally…

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon. I’ll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don’t log into this account all that much, so I’m sorry if I don’t get to your comment as quickly as you’d like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
>""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

Please start exercising,"I’ve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don’t notice them. I’ve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I’m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven’t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don’t overwhelm yourself. You’ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I’m sorry to anyone who said they’re unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you’re having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. 

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it’s subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It’s not perfect but it’s just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength.",anxiety,,ER,15.9500319,37.9999668

"Most people are accepting of you having an anxiety disorder, but an unfortunate amount of people expect you to only have symptoms in private.","A stigma that I’ve noticed in the mental health community... so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences, but oh no.. don’t have a panic attack in front of them, don’t seek re-assurance from today’s anxious thoughts and jitters. 

This is something that needs changing. It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work. Even if the circumstances of the blip in their health was due to poor diet or a rough week (I had a co-worker that had this happen at work) but when I struggled with low mood I was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ 

This is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I’m lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. 

I felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you’ve been accepted or told to ‘hide’ symptoms from the public to spare THEIR discomfort... like your doing it on purpose. ",anxiety,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
"After a lifelong needle phobia, I managed to get my COVID vaccine!","(I'll be discussing needles and medical stuff in this post!) 

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!",anxiety,,phobia,48.8351638,2.3609876

My best friend became a mass murderer. I’ve never been the same since that day.,"So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It’s been several years, about 6, and while I’ll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   

First off for context, I’m just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  

[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       

Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn’t help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   

A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I’m pretty sure he either didn’t want to subject me to that or something.   

When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn’t even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. 

When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn’t do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn’t realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  

The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he’d try to change the subject. Don’t get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   

When the murders happened, I didn’t even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn’t feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like “oh let’s smoke a bowl that’ll cheer you up!” And that was when I had my first panic attack. I’m talking full on “I’m gonna die oh my god.” This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn’t sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn’t know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I’ve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it’s caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can’t really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don’t really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he’s never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I’m kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It’s hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can’t focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I’d love to answer, but I’d also love some advice and support.

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I’m in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don’t deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that’s stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a “haha I got you” thing that he loved doing.

Anyone else have super bad anxiety about being late but then the depression sets in and you’re just chronically late to everything cause you don’t care anymore? And then you feel guilty?,"This is going to sound so weird, which is why I really want to see if anyone else feels like this. 

I have awful anxiety and always plan out my routine with at least an hour gap of having to get somewhere. But when the time comes to actually leave the house, I... can’t? Like the ability to get out of bed, to put clothes on, take my pills, to ensure I put some sort of substance into my body... is exhausting and I keep putting it off until I’m literally so late that it makes me hate myself even more. But yet the consequences of my actions aren’t as anxiety inducing now that I realize that I’m late? 

I lay there like “oh I should leave in 10 minutes but I haven’t even gotten up... what is the point?” and then drag myself out of bed, cursing myself for giving in. 

And then the entire time I’m on my way there, my depression hits and I’m beating myself up because DUH, I’m awfully late and now the other party who told me a time to meet up has to wait for my sad, pathetic self to show up. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t think this is normal? Can anyone relate or am I crazy?",anxiety,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908

You aren’t dying.,"You aren’t dying. You don’t have a rare disease or cancer. No tumors or some weird flesh eating virus that hasn’t been seen in decades. You aren’t going insane. You don’t have MS, or any other genetic disorder. You have anxiety. May I suggest a list of good vibes for this spooky season?? 

1) love yourself. Actually mean it though. Look in the mirror and instead of analyzing your body over anything that appears to be different tell yourself how amazing you are. 

2) drink water, I mean lots of water, drink some liquid IV also. Comes in many flavors and it’s a lot healthier than other drinks. Try to lay off the sodas (however treat yourself every now and then)

3) sleep. I mean sleep like you never slept before. Go to bed earlier, turn your phone on airplane mode and just let the cold room engulf you as if you are in the Arctic (that’s how cold I love it) 

4) eat healthier. Try not to eat chips, junk food. Baked chicken and veggies are great always. (Again treat yourself every once in awhile) 

5) breathing exercises. This is a great way to relieve stress and anxiety. Did you know breathing can help with a lot of medical problems? I suggest you read a book called “Breath” by James Nestor. It’s an extraordinary piece of work.

Remember to love yourself and remember that I love you.",anxiety,,MS,16.7417041,-62.1916844
Really missing the pre-COVID world when my severe anxiety was just cuz of regular trauma lmao,"Hi beautiful people ❤️ Just wanted to vent here over the same feelings everyone else probably has. 

I’ve been watching a lot of shows (haven’t we all tbh) lately and seeing people living normally onscreen makes me so sad. I’ve become so used to how we’re living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I’ve been feeling. I hate that I’m afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we’re in a long distance relationship when he’s only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can’t hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai’i (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it’s so emotionally draining. And it doesn’t help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don’t follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it’s like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn’t do the same so I’m worried that it’s all for nothing. We’ve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I’m just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can’t. And I know I can’t. I just wish I could. 

I just needed to vent because like everyone else, I just feel so drained. But I still feel lucky to have what and who I have at the same time. I just wish this was over already. It feels like it won’t ever be.",anxiety,,Hawai’i,19.593801499999998,-155.42837009716908
Anyone always have a show playing in the background to help anxiety?,"For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks. She accepted shows playing 24/7 but she didn't get it like y'all do :)",anxiety,,Brooklyn,40.6526006,-73.9497211
Got cured of Generalized Anxiety Disorder! Here's what worked for me!,"Hey guys, I have been an avid follower of this sub for a long time and this place has been a constant source of panic attack relievers over the last few months. In my last session with my therapist, he told me that GAD is cured after 6 months of literal hell and dedication. I want to share what worked for me.

**Background:** As with my fellow GAD sufferers, I have been suffering from constant worries and usual panic attacks over the last few years but I decided to take action about this (didn't know it was GAD back then) after a full-blown attack that lasted for hours and hours in early May this year. Started my treatment late May. In one of the panic attacks I was contemplating committing suicide but thank god I had the courage to stick to my routine.

**Symptoms:** Luckily, never had any physical symptoms but diarrohea and mouth ulcers were common because of cortisol developed by Amygdala.

**Aftermath:** I am waking up everyday with a buoyant mood and my life including social life, dating life and academic performance, all have improved!

So, let's finally begin:

1. **Therapy:** Can't emphasize this more, CBT therapists will identify the problematic and impractical thought patterns associted with your Anxiety( especially if it's Cortex-based) and suggest you ways to cope with them via ABCDE, RRR techniques and so on. Some of these will work for you will and some not but these people are medical experts and you need to spend 2-3 months with a therapist before deciding to discontinue/move to a different Therapist. Self-therapy books do help but it's always better to have someone in the form of close friend or a therapist to assist in your journey.
2. **Reading Books:** Rewire your Anxious Brain, The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety, and My Age of Anxiety,  are the top 3 books I recommend. Finally, I'd suggest reading posts on this sub. **Caution:** there are chances of feeling uneasiness or having panic attacks by reading few content so make sure you tell your brain that this is medicine beforehand
3. **Meditation:** atleast 2-3 times in a day for 12.5 mins everyday. It's only one day in the last 6 months I missed doing this wonderful thing.Buddhist style of meditation worked for me. Mantra meditation, guided meditation are other alternatives. There are wide variety of resources available online. It could be possible that you don't see the effects in the initial few weeks but I'd suggest keep doing it blindly.
4. **Gym:**  6 days a week non-stop in the last 6 months except for the weeks when I was travelling. It's scientifically proven that doing physical activity for more than 20 mins almost everyday improves mental health. Technically, doing exercises helps the body release endorphins that rearrange the synapse between the neurons if done for 10 weeks to see a significant results. This is massive in improving thought patterns
5. **Being open:** Being open about your anxiety with your closed ones will enable to learn new strategies, perspectives and many more things. More importantly, you will have shoulders to fall upon during a full-blown panic attack

**Others:** practicing gratitude daily, practicing my hobbies( soccer).

"I decided to fight for net neutrality, even with social anxiety. It has been the easiest thing ever.","I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.

So this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes — whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology — it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion — something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.

The main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...

**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: ""Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.""

**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer — often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.

**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom — it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, ""You're doing great!""), and it automatically calls the next representative.

-----

At the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.

Long story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.

P.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.

**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. Turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like I made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. It also means I actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good.",anxiety,,P.S.,52.3706915,4.8843048
Does anyone else get nauseous when they get anxious but become scared of throwing up so it gets stuck on a loop?,"My anxiety is most commonly tied to my stomach.

Anyone else getting really anxious with all the COVID restrictions lifting?,"I am slowly realizing where my anxiousness has come from over the last couple of days. I have been handling my anxiety quite well over the last few months after having figured out some of my major trigger. With numbers going down in my city, restaurants are opening back up and people want to meet and socialize I have felt much more anxious over the last few days. 

I got quite comfortable in my covid routing and bubble over the last year. It hasn't taken all of the anxiety away but reduced the social aspect by a lot (maybe not to my long term advantage though). 

I have vacation time planned in the next few weeks and just had an anxiety attack over planning on where to go/what to do for just a couple of days. Last year a friend and I planned to take a trip together, which we now had to cancel because I could not get vaccinated early enough. Now we want to spend the time together in some other way and while trying to find some options closer to home I realized what I have been so anxious about. Going out, meeting other people, stepping out of my routine and comfort zone. Its crazy. I used to thrive with travel and new cultures/people and today I caught myself hoping that guidelines won't be relaxed so that I have a good excuse to stay in my bubble.... 

I have honestly no idea what to do with this. I need to stay careful and take precautions for my physical health (pre-existing conditions) while I cannot neglect my mental health but am not sure if its better to just go for it or let my anxiety dictate my vacation plans and social life again....

I hate constantly feeling like someone is mad at me,"It’s so tiring to constantly worry and have to check with people if they are mad. It makes people feel like I make everything about myself. When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It’s just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I’ve made immense progress but it’s never going to be normal again. I can’t stop feeling guilty for everything I’ve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I’m worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can’t let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn’t even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I’m tired of thoughts that I’m a horrible person. I’m just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I’m in a group of people having fun. And I’m able to make them laugh. Whenever I’m alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I’m worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there’s gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It’s just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.


Edit: I’m kinda thinking this might be because I’ve forgotten my anxiety meds for a few days. Uhhh whoops. Well im going to get back on track and see how that helps. But I’m so nervous I can’t stop hyper focusing on one situation and it’s been a year and it wasn’t even a big deal when it happened

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel “god I must be so terrible, that’s why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others” 

Then I reach out or try to communicate my situation gently, (even asking honestly AITA). the response is more like “Hmm tbh I haven’t really been putting effort into doing things or seeing people. Not that I don’t ask to do things but... I just am not expecting to do anything maybe? Or expecting people to do things with me? And so, if people reach out to me, that’s cool.

Since the fall things have slowly been getting worse, I’m constantly worried that any slight change in how I feel is covid-related, and I’m terrified of being the reason someone I care about dies of covid. It’s affected my appetite, making me lose weight, made me cry much more often than ever before, and avoid seeing even the two friends I decided to share a “bubble” with when this all began. Has anyone else experienced this? I don’t know what to do to control it or convince myself that I’m not sick when every week I have a new reason to think otherwise",anxiety,,US,39.7837304,-100.445882
Anyone else get anxiety poops?,"For as long as I can remember whenever I have a bout of anxiety I end up spending a large portion of my day on the toilet pooping.

Recently in the UK it’s been quite hot and the heat triggers my anxiety, so I’m currently sat on the white throne pooping my guts out.

Just wondering if anyone else suffers like this as well 😂

Stay safe out there guys x",anxiety,,UK,6.3110548,20.5447525
does anyone else sometimes feel PHYSICALLY sick from anxiety?,"about a year and a half ago i had just found out my partner at the time had been cheating on me for 4 months, i felt stupid and betrayed and i felt like the blood in my body was moving around too fast? like my stomach had flipped and i couldn’t breathe properly and then i started feeling sick, i feel sick all the time. like at least once a day, so i wasn’t worried about it but then i suddenly felt something go up my throat and i had to run to the toilet and i was sick, quite a lot. i cried for a while and forgave them, it happened again but it’s over now and i’m with someone that makes me really happy but some things still make me feel like that, i haven’t been properly sick again since but things like exams and especially my speaking exam that’s coming up (next week) make me super anxious and honestly just getting up and going to school. i feel like i have to put in double the effort to do anything that other people do, and it really sucks.",anxiety,,n’t,37.9456724,23.7139908
Ukraine Megathread,"Update 4/15: A group of people from this community have created r/UkraineAnxiety

Update 4/13: We have decided to formally close this thread to new comments. We feel that this thread is too taxing for us to moderate and is no longer worth the strain on our mod team like it was back when the situation was brand new. We want to thank everyone who has stuck around to help others stay level-headed through this whole mess!

Update 3/27: Due to all the feedback we got from updates 3/20 and 3/21, we have decided to relax the requirements for posting links. You are free to post a link you want help with or to add commentary on to help others understand it in a less anxious way, and now you can once again post links to good news as well as create good news collections (see the current stickied comment which includes some info on reassurance-seeking behavior). Our one requirement is that you should refrain from posting multiple times over a short period with good news links. If someone does this we will begin taking down their comments as spam. In this case it would be better to put together multiple news links and then post them as a single comment.

*~~Update 3/21: Please see the current stickied comment for more information. It is ok to include a link that is causing you anxiety and asking people to help explain it better. It is also ok to provide a news link alongside your own commentary about the article to help people understand what it is saying in a less anxious way. We're specifically going to remove comments that have one or more news links without asking for help or providing original commentary about the article.~~*

*~~Update 3/20: We have seen a large amount of posts that are mainly about sharing/discussing specific news articles. Please remember to keep everything relevant to anxiety. If a comment is just a news link then we have decided we will have to remove it to keep the thread on topic.~~*

Hi everyone,

It has been requested that we create a megathread for all of the events that have been happening with regards to the conflict in Ukraine. We decided that this is a good idea since so many people have been experiencing extreme anxiety because of it.

We have opted to have this thread be sorted by Best for the time being. To read and respond to the latest comments you can manually change the sort to New. The reason we’re doing this is because we want the most helpful and most grounded comments to float to the top to help as many people as possible keep their anxiety under control during this difficult time.

For those who want to talk with other anxiety sufferers in more of a live format, feel free to join our official Discord server with this invite link: [https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9](https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9). We have added a special channel to it called ""#ukrainediscussion"" so people can talk about what's happening and help each other.

As always please remember to be supportive and report any problematic comments so we can remove them as soon as possible.

Thanks!

The r/Anxiety Mod Team",anxiety,,Ukraine,49.4871968,31.2718321
